Current Deficit: Inadequate Treasury Management and Liquidity Forecasting Processes
• Implement a centralized treasury management platform that produces tangible outputs such as daily liquidity reports, next-day funding projections, and cumulative five-day and 30-day liquidity forecasts. These reports and dashboards must automatically track funding, liquidity, and capital needs and generate alerts when forecasts deviate from expected parameters.

Current Deficit: Insufficient Comprehensive Liability Composition Analysis
• Establish a robust liability management system that generates detailed, automated reports categorizing all liabilities by type, term to maturity, secured versus unsecured status, and key contractual details (including public issuance, call rights, and indenture trustee information). The system must deliver a comprehensive liability profile that supports internal stress testing and meets regulatory reporting requirements.
