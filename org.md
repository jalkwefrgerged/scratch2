Below is a consolidated list of process-oriented gaps and recommended approaches:

1. **Current Deficit: Unstructured Process for Mapping Legal Entities, Core Business Lines, and Material Entities**  
   • Develop a standardized, repeatable methodology for identifying and updating the bank’s legal entities (including parent and affiliates), core business lines, and branches, with clear criteria to determine and flag material entities.

2. **Current Deficit: Minimal Capability to Identify and Quantify Additional Value or Reliance on Parent or Affiliate Operations**  
   • Implement a technology-enabled, structured methodology that identifies core business lines drawing additional value from, or relying on, parent or affiliate operations—particularly cross-border relationships. Incorporate quantitative metrics (e.g., assets, revenue) into ongoing monitoring processes to maintain a clear, up-to-date view of these dependencies.

**Current Deficit: Minimal Oversight and Technology Support for Tracking Additional Value From Parent or Affiliate Operations**  
• Deploy a technology platform and corresponding governance framework to systematically detect when core business lines depend on, or draw added value from, parent or affiliate entities—particularly those with cross-border activities. Ensure quantitative metrics (e.g., assets, revenue) are integrated into regular oversight routines, so that any operational reliance is continuously monitored and promptly updated for resolution planning.


**Current Deficit: Ad Hoc Approach to Branch and Deposit Reporting**  
• Establish a structured, automated reporting capability that enables the bank to quickly produce branch-specific deposit data—including total balances and insured vs. uninsured segmentation—for each domestic and foreign location. This framework should align with FDIC resolution requirements, ensuring immediate availability of accurate deposit information to facilitate prompt deposit insurance determinations and related obligations in a failure scenario.

**Current Deficit: No Automated Mechanism to Flag Regulated Subsidiaries or Cross-Border Operations**  
• Implement a process-driven classification and reporting capability that detects when any subsidiary or office meets regulated criteria (e.g., broker-dealer, insurance entity) or has cross-border dimensions. This capability should document key details—such as asset sizes, supervisory requirements, and overall significance to the bank’s core lines of business—ensuring that any scenario requiring special attention is promptly identified and addressed.
