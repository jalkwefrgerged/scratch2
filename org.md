Below is a consolidated list of process-oriented gaps and recommended approaches:


**Current Deficit: Minimal Oversight and Technology Support for Tracking Additional Value From Parent or Affiliate Operations**  
• Deploy a technology platform and corresponding governance framework to systematically detect when core business lines depend on, or draw added value from, parent or affiliate entities—particularly those with cross-border activities. Ensure quantitative metrics (e.g., assets, revenue) are integrated into regular oversight routines, so that any operational reliance is continuously monitored and promptly updated for resolution planning.


**Current Deficit: Ad Hoc Approach to Branch and Deposit Reporting**  
• Establish a structured, automated reporting capability that quickly generates branch-specific deposit balances (domestic and foreign), aligning with FDIC resolution expectations and enabling timely, accurate data availability in a failure scenario.

**Current Deficit: No Automated Mechanism to Flag Regulated Subsidiaries or Cross-Border Operations**  
• Implement a process-driven classification and reporting capability that detects when any subsidiary or office meets regulated criteria (e.g., broker-dealer, insurance entity) or has cross-border dimensions. This capability should document key details—such as asset sizes, supervisory requirements, and overall significance to the bank’s core lines of business—ensuring that any scenario requiring special attention is promptly identified and addressed.
