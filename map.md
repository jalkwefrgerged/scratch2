**Current Deficit: Absence of a Bank-Wide Process for Identifying and Mitigating Sale Impediments**  
• Create a cross-functional framework that routinely flags legal, contractual, or operational barriers to selling each asset portfolio and outlines strategies—including timelines and responsible parties—to overcome these obstacles in a resolution.


**Current Deficit: No Real-Time Capability for Scenario-Adjusted Valuations in a Resolution**  
• Implement a robust, stress-oriented valuation methodology—capable of quickly adjusting to distressed sale or partial disposal conditions—to produce credible, near real-time prices for each major asset portfolio. This ensures the bank can present accurate, actionable valuations to regulators and potential buyers under tight resolution timelines.
