Below are potential gaps worth mentioning, all focused on high‐level processes and capabilities needed to ensure the bank can rapidly identify and manage non-depositor unsecured creditors in a resolution scenario:

---

**Current Deficit: Narrow Scope of Existing Unsecured Creditor Identification**  
• Expand coverage beyond letters of credit and derivative exposures to include all forms of unsecured debt (e.g., bonds, notes, indentured securities). A comprehensive framework ensures that any unsecured liability—whether at the CIDI or a material subsidiary—is promptly detected and cataloged.

**Current Deficit: No Formal Mechanism To Capture and Update Inter-Creditor Agreements**  
• Establish a structured repository and governance process to store, review, and revise all inter-creditor agreements. This ensures clarity on creditor rights and priorities, facilitating swift resolution actions or negotiations if the bank is under distress.

**Current Deficit: Unclear Procedures for Trustee Information on Indentured Securities**  
• Integrate trustee data fields (e.g., trustee name, contact details, applicable indenture terms) into existing unsecured creditor tracking systems. This allows the bank to readily identify the right entity (or entities) to engage in a crisis scenario.

**Current Deficit: Lack of an Automated, On-Demand Reporting Capability**  
• Develop a single reporting interface that compiles creditor details (e.g., name, address, liability type, amount owed, trustee info) on demand. This functionality should encompass both the CIDI and any material subsidiary, ensuring immediate visibility in a failure event.

**Current Deficit: Limited Procedures for Ongoing Data Validation and Expansion**  
• Implement periodic reconciliation cycles to keep unsecured creditor data accurate. These cycles should also include triggers (e.g., when a subsidiary becomes “material”) to automatically extend creditor identification and reporting requirements to new entities.

**Current Deficit: Insufficient Testing of Systems and Data Retrieval**  
• Conduct regular drills or simulations to verify that staff can quickly access, consolidate, and validate unsecured creditor data from multiple repositories. Testing should confirm that the system’s output is both complete and ready to be shared with regulators or resolution teams under tight timeframes.
