**Non-Depositor Unsecured Claims Identification Narrative**  
**Bank Name:** ABC Bank  
**Date:** July 1, 2024  

---

**I. Introduction**  
**Purpose and Scope:**  
This document describes the systems, processes, and recordkeeping practices ABC Bank employs to identify and track all unsecured creditors that are not depositors. In addition, it outlines the methodology used for capturing such information at the parent institution level (CIDI) and for each material subsidiary. This narrative is prepared in accordance with the regulatory requirement that mandates a full resolution submission to include a description of these processes and systems.

**Regulatory Context:**  
In compliance with the FDIC’s final rule on resolution planning, this narrative addresses the requirement to identify and describe our systems and processes used to track non-deposit unsecured liabilities—including the storage of records and the details captured for each creditor.

**II. Overview of Systems and Processes**  
**A. General Description:**  
ABC Bank utilizes an integrated Debt Management System (DMS) to capture and manage all information related to its unsecured liabilities. This system is part of our enterprise risk and finance platform, ensuring consistent data capture across the bank and its material subsidiaries.

**B. System Architecture and Tools:**  
- **Automated Data Capture:** Our DMS automatically imports creditor data from our general ledger and accounts payable systems.  
- **Manual Controls:** In addition to automated imports, periodic manual reconciliations are performed by the Finance Control Team to ensure completeness and accuracy.  
- **Reporting and Analytics:** The system generates periodic reports that are reviewed by our senior management to verify that all unsecured creditor information is current and complete.

**C. Process Flow:**  
1. **Data Input:** Unsecured debt information is input into the DMS via electronic feeds from our accounting systems.  
2. **Data Verification:** The Finance Control Team reviews and reconciles imported data against contractual documents and financial statements.  
3. **Data Storage and Update:** Once verified, creditor data is stored in our secure Oracle-based repository with regular backups and encryption.  
4. **Reporting:** Automated reports are generated monthly and quarterly to support internal reviews and regulatory submissions.

**III. Identification of Unsecured Creditors**  
**A. Identification at the Parent (CIDI) Level:**  
- ABC Bank’s DMS is configured to identify unsecured creditors not classified as depositors. For example, any creditor issuing unsecured notes, bonds, or other non-deposit instruments is flagged in the system.  
- Data inputs include contractual information obtained from legal and finance teams, ensuring that each creditor’s details are captured accurately.

**B. Identification for Material Subsidiaries:**  
- Each material subsidiary uses a standardized process aligned with the parent institution’s DMS.  
- Subsidiary data is either directly fed into the central system or maintained in subsidiary-specific modules that are reconciled with the parent’s records.  
- The process ensures that for every material subsidiary, unsecured creditors are identified in a similar manner to the parent—ensuring consistency across the group.

**IV. Recordkeeping Practices and Data Management**  
**A. Location and Storage of Records:**  
- All records related to unsecured debt are stored in a secure, centralized Oracle database housed in ABC Bank’s primary data center.  
- Electronic records are maintained on encrypted servers with strict access controls, ensuring compliance with internal and regulatory standards.

**B. Recordkeeping Processes:**  
- **Data Maintenance:** The Finance Control Team conducts monthly reviews to update creditor records and reconcile them with the latest contractual and financial data.  
- **Audit Trails:** Our DMS maintains an audit log that records all changes to creditor information, providing full traceability.  
- **Backups and Security:** Daily backups and routine data integrity checks are performed to safeguard against data loss.

**C. Inter-Creditor Agreements:**  
- Details of any inter-creditor agreements related to unsecured debt are maintained within the same system.  
- These agreements are stored as part of the creditor file with appropriate metadata (e.g., agreement date, parties involved) and are reviewed annually to ensure alignment with the recorded debt data.

**V. Detailed Creditor Identification Capabilities**  
**A. Data Elements Captured for Each Creditor:**  
For every unsecured creditor, ABC Bank’s system captures and stores the following key details:  
- **Name:** Example – “XYZ Capital Partners, LLC”  
- **Address:** Example – “1234 Market Street, Suite 500, Anytown, USA 12345”  
- **Nature of the Liability:** Example – “Unsecured subordinated note” or “Unsecured bond issuance”  
- **Amount Owed:** Example – “$5,000,000 outstanding balance”  

**B. Special Considerations for Indentured Securities:**  
- When the unsecured liability involves indentured securities, the system also records the identity of the indenture trustee.  
  - *Example:* For a set of indentured bonds, the record will include:  
    - **Creditor Name:** “ABC Bondholders Group”  
    - **Indenture Trustee:** “National Trustee Services, Inc.”  

**C. Data Collection and Verification:**  
- Creditor data is collected through a combination of automated inputs and manual document review by the Legal and Finance teams.  
- Regular cross-checks with contractual records, auditor reports, and external databases ensure the information is accurate and up-to-date.

**VI. Ongoing Monitoring and Updates**  
**A. Regular Review Processes:**  
- **Quarterly Reconciliations:** The Finance Control Team reviews all unsecured debt records quarterly.  
- **Annual Audits:** An independent internal audit is conducted annually to ensure that creditor records are accurate and reflect current liabilities.

**B. Change Management:**  
- **Notification Procedures:** Any new unsecured debt issuances or changes (such as creditor name or amount adjustments) trigger an immediate update in the DMS.  
- **Review Meetings:** Quarterly review meetings are held with Finance, Legal, and Operations teams to address any discrepancies or updates.  
- **System Alerts:** The DMS is configured to generate alerts if discrepancies arise between the recorded data and external verification sources.
