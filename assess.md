In compliance with the FDIC’s regulatory requirement, CIBC Bank USA has undertaken a thorough evaluation of potential factors that may materially impede an orderly resolution. This evaluation stems from robust internal analysis by senior management, risk management, operational teams, and compliance officers, each contributing to a nuanced understanding of key vulnerabilities. A prominent consideration is the bank’s reliance on third-party service providers for critical operational and technological functions—such as core banking systems, digital banking platforms, and cybersecurity. These external dependencies, while essential to everyday efficiency, pose challenges if uninterrupted service is needed during a receivership. To address this, CIBC Bank USA employs contractual agreements incorporating resolution-friendly clauses designed to ensure continued vendor support even under distressed conditions, with contract details and service-level requirements meticulously documented and routinely updated.

Beyond vendor dependencies, the bank acknowledges the operational complexity inherent in transitioning significant commercial lending portfolios (including commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans) under stressed circumstances. Despite these loans being standardized and comprehensively documented, their volume and geographic concentration could complicate a rapid transfer or sale. To mitigate such delays, the bank has set up virtual data rooms and instituted standardized documentation protocols, providing immediate access to due diligence materials for potential purchasers or transitional teams. Liquidity considerations also figure prominently in this assessment, specifically regarding the proportion of uninsured deposits. Although CIBC Bank USA maintains robust liquidity reserves and contingency funding strategies, a high concentration of uninsured deposits may heighten withdrawal risk during crises. Ongoing liquidity stress testing and contingency planning offer essential safeguards in this regard.

Recent internal reviews have additionally highlighted technological and process gaps across reporting and data management functions. The bank currently lacks an automated, structured system for branch-specific deposit data, making it more cumbersome to distinguish between insured and uninsured deposits on short notice—a critical capability during resolution. Similarly, reliance on manual procedures to collate data for Call Report memoranda risks inaccuracies under time pressure. Key depositor reporting and deposit data validation are likewise not fully automated, which can slow the bank’s ability to analyze depositor relationships and reconcile insured versus uninsured balances rapidly. At a broader level, the absence of a formal, resolution-specific framework for defining and monitoring critical shared services may complicate decisions around which internal functions must remain operational. Insufficient tracking and classification of Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs) and related off-balance sheet exposures amplify the risk of abrupt defaults or legal complications in a distress scenario, while incomplete tracking of inter-affiliate funding and capital structures may produce imprecise liquidity projections. These reporting challenges also include a lack of a unified data repository for franchise components, potentially impeding swift divestitures or sales of business lines. Further, the current lack of robust oversight and technology to track instances where core business lines rely on parent or affiliate resources presents a material risk. This gap is particularly relevant in a cross-border context, given CIBC Bank USA’s ultimate parent entity in Canada, where shared brand reputation, personnel, and integrated processes could complicate an orderly separation. Without clear visibility into these operational touchpoints, the CIDI may face unforeseen legal, operational, or contractual barriers during resolution, potentially delaying or complicating the divestiture of critical functions or lines of business.

In response, CIBC Bank USA is advancing strategic enhancements to its management information systems (MIS) and data reporting frameworks, aiming to automate and integrate core processes that support quick, accurate, and consistent resolution-critical data. Efforts include developing real-time deposit reporting tools, upgrading treasury tracking systems, and building a resolution-specific service taxonomy to clarify which internal resources must continue without disruption. These upgrades complement existing contingency measures, such as rigorous vendor oversight, robust documentation practices, and stress-tested liquidity plans, all of which collectively strengthen the bank’s resolution readiness. By addressing these technological and procedural shortfalls in conjunction with established contractual safeguards and proactive portfolio management, CIBC Bank USA believes it is well-positioned to mitigate the identified material impediments and uphold operational continuity, market stability, and depositor confidence in a resolution scenario.
