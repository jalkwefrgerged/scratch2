**Current Deficit: Inadequate End-to-End Process for Planning, Executing, and Evolving From Contingency Exercises**  
â€¢ Implement a governance-driven approach that (1) establishes a repeatable method to plan and document resolution-focused exercises (e.g., simulations, tabletop drills); (2) captures and integrates key findings into relevant resolution capabilities (e.g., data reporting, communication protocols); and (3) formally oversees outcome reviews and remedial actions through a designated committee or senior manager. This approach ensures each exercise is purposeful, lessons learned are adopted, and updates are consistently reflected in the next resolution submission.
