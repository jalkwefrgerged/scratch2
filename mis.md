Below is an updated list of gaps that incorporates additional considerations around front-office digital platforms for sale in resolution, and the need to distinguish MIS ownership between bank and non-bank entities:

---

**Current Deficit: No Formal, Ongoing Process for Maintaining and Improving MIS Inventory**  
• Implement a structured, repeatable approach to (1) keep an up-to-date catalog of every key MIS and digital platform required for resolution—including those in the front office that could be sold as part of a franchise component—and (2) continuously identify and address deficiencies (e.g., incomplete integration or limited reporting capabilities). Make sure the inventory explicitly tracks whether each system is bank-owned or owned by a non-bank legal entity, so the bank can appropriately plan for separation in resolution. Define timelines, accountability measures, and periodic checkpoints to ensure the bank remains resolution-ready.

**Current Deficit: Absence of a Standardized Method for Ensuring Resolution Access to Non-Owned Systems**  
• Develop a formal procedure to evaluate and record contract terms, projected costs, and alternative arrangements for any system the bank does not fully own—particularly when a non-bank entity or affiliate holds the licensing rights. This must include strategies for sustaining or replacing these systems if the non-bank owner is in a separate resolution, ensuring ongoing functionality for the CIDI’s operations or prospective buyers of any franchise component.

**Current Deficit: Insufficient Governance Over Data Collection and Maintenance**  
• Establish clear roles, responsibilities, and controls to verify data integrity, timeliness, and completeness in all relevant MIS—including a governance structure that oversees front-office digital platforms vital to franchise components. This should include auditing, review protocols, and sign-off processes ensuring the data required for a resolution submission is accurate, readily available, and appropriately segmented between bank and non-bank ownership.
