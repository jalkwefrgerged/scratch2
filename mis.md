Below is the consolidated set of gaps for the given rule set regarding key management information systems and applications:

---

**Current Deficit: No Formal, Ongoing Process for Maintaining and Improving MIS Inventory**  
• Implement a structured, repeatable approach that both (1) keeps an up-to-date catalog of each management information system (e.g., ownership/licensing details, key personnel, contract terms), and (2) continuously identifies, prioritizes, and remediates deficiencies (e.g., incomplete integration, limited reporting capabilities). Define clear timelines, accountability measures, and periodic checkpoints to validate progress and ensure resolution-readiness.

**Current Deficit: Absence of a Standardized Method for Ensuring Resolution Access to Non-Owned Systems**  
• Develop a procedure to evaluate contract terms and projected costs, and specify how continuity will be maintained for any third-party or affiliate-owned systems in a failure scenario. This should include alternatives or contingency plans for preserving or replacing critical functionality if access is restricted.

**Current Deficit: Insufficient Governance Over Data Collection and Maintenance**  
• Establish clear roles, responsibilities, and controls for verifying data integrity, timeliness, and completeness within each relevant system. This governance structure should include audits, review protocols, and sign-off processes that ensure the data required for the full resolution submission is accurate and readily available.
