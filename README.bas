**INVESTIGATION OUTCOME**
An investigation was performed on the account activity of HH LIQUOR, KEG LIQUOR and ZOUHAIR GEORGE SAFAR. A SAR is not being filed due to the lack of evidence that suspicious activity was present.

**Why the detected activity is not suspicious (Activity Summary & Support)**

* **Source of funds & inflow/outflow match.** Daily cash deposits (USD 231,393) align with retail liquor sales volumes shown in open-source reviews (two small off-sale liquor stores with lottery and EBT). Cheque withdrawals (USD 96,545) are payable almost entirely to documented beverage wholesalers (Harbor Distributing LLC, Reyes Beer Division, Southern Wine & Spirits) or California Lottery.
* **Clear business purpose for “cash-in / cheque-out” velocity.** 16 of 18 cheque debits (85 %) were supported by invoices provided by the branch; the remaining two cheques were to a new vendor (“West Coast Spirits”) with onboarding packet on file. No cheques to “Cash” or to the proprietor were identified.
* **No unexplained counterparties.** ACH credits originate from Merchant Bankcard processors (card settlements) and Beyond Bancard; ACH debits flow to California Dept of Tax & Fee Administration and IRS.
* **Open-source research found no sanctions, litigation, or adverse media** for the proprietor or either DBA (see links in CUSTOMER section).
* **Internal linkage confirmed.** Both DBAs share the same EIN (-3628) and address records; cheque payees are external wholesalers, not internal book transfers.
