**Current Deficit: Inadequate Identification of Potential Barriers and Obstacles to Separation**  
• Implement a structured review and documentation process to uncover any material barriers—such as shared contracts, critical dependencies, or cross-entity guarantees—that could impede a timely, cost-effective separation of the CIDI from the parent. This process should outline clear remediation steps and mitigating responses to ensure the CIDI can stand alone or transition to a bridge bank without undue delay.

**Current Deficit: Lack of Ongoing Assessment of Interconnections and Interdependencies**  
• Establish a recurring governance process that continuously maps and evaluates all interconnections between the CIDI, its subsidiaries, and parent affiliates. By routinely flagging and examining new or evolving dependencies, the bank can address potential separation risks early—before they escalate into material obstacles in a resolution scenario.

**Current Deficit: Absence of Scenario-Based Analysis for Bridge Bank Operations**  
• Develop a structured, technology-supported approach to simulate how the CIDI would function independently if the parent enters bankruptcy or another insolvency regime. This scenario-based analysis should capture the operational, financial, and contractual aspects of disentangling shared services, enabling proactive mitigation of any risks or cost drivers that emerge.
