A non-deposit claim is a liability that arises from sources other than customer deposits—typically unsecured obligations that aren’t backed by collateral or deposit insurance. For example, an unsecured bond is a non-deposit claim because the bank issues it to raise funds from investors without pledging specific collateral. If certain trigger events occur, such as in a resolution scenario, these liabilities can crystallize into payable obligations that the bank must settle.
