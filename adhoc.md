The regulation requires that banks document robust systems for identifying all unsecured non-deposit creditors across both the parent and its materially significant subsidiaries. This includes liabilities such as unsecured bonds, drawn letters of credit, derivative exposures, and other contingent obligations that could materialize into claims even if not currently evident. Simply stating that there are no unsecured creditors is insufficient, as regulators require detailed processes and recordkeeping to ensure that any potential claims can be accurately identified and managed in a resolution scenario. Comprehensive documentation is essential for orderly resolution, supporting measures like bail-in to protect public funds and maintain financial stability.
