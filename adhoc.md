In a Group B informational filing, it is now considered standard market practice to provide specific references to U.S. GAAP guidelines—particularly ASC 815—when describing how you handle Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs). The FDIC’s QFC regulatory text (12 CFR 360.10(d)(14)(i)–(iv)) requires a high‐level yet thorough overview of the types of QFCs you engage in, any major counterparties with significant notional amounts, your booking models (including back‐to‐back and remote bookings), and your use of QFCs for hedging or liquidity purposes. In addition, you should identify which transactions receive hedge accounting treatment, how they are monitored, and how they tie back to core business lines. While you need not provide an exhaustive technical discussion, citing relevant GAAP sections and summarizing key processes—such as how you track hedge effectiveness, manage collateral, or address operational challenges—demonstrates that your QFC practices align with recognized industry frameworks. This transparent accounting reference also reassures regulators and auditors that your bank can readily identify and manage critical exposures, particularly in a resolution scenario, thus reinforcing your institution’s operational readiness and compliance.
