This content is provided to fully adddress the this subsection of the reguatory text and allign CIBC's submission with peer institutions. The FDIC expects banks to clearly identify hedging transactions that qualify for hedge accounting, describe hedges associated with core business lines, and outline the bank’s practices and reporting capabilities related to hedge accounting and other end-user hedges. To achieve this clarity, references to specific accounting standards—such as ASC 815—are included, as these standards directly indicate how particular hedges are designated and accounted for under U.S. GAAP. Providing sufficient detail, such as including explicit references to relevant accounting standards such as ASC 815, helps regulators verify precisely how hedges are identified, monitored, and reported. This enables regulators to clearly understand the bank’s accounting practices and assess its operational readiness to manage hedging exposures effectively in a potential resolution scenario.
