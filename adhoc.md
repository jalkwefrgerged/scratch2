A letter of credit can become a non-deposit claim if the beneficiary draws on it and the bank does not promptly settle the payment obligation. In a resolution scenario, any drawn amount that remains unpaid is treated as an unsecured liability and qualifies as a non-deposit claim subject to resolution measures. An easier example of a non-deposit claim would be an unsecured bond, as it represents a debt obligation that is not backed by collateral. In a resolution scenario, the unsecured bond remains a non-deposit claim, meaning that its holders may be subject to loss absorption measures, such as bail-in, if the bank's financial condition deteriorates.
