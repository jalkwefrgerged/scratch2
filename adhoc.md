It is not advisable to delete the section and simply state that there are no unsecured creditors. Instead, you should document your systems and processes for identifying all potential unsecured non-deposit creditors at the CIDI, as required by the regulatory text. This documentation ensures that, even if no such claims exist today, any potential future claim can be accurately identified and managed in a resolution scenario. The FDIC expects to see evidence of a robust tracking system that supports effective resolution planning.
