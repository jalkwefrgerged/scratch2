Below are the key QFC-related gaps **not** addressed in your current list of three, each framed in the format we’ve been using:

---

**Current Deficit: No Resolution-Focused Protections in QFC Documentation**  
• **Recommendation**: Adopt the QFC Protocol (or similar resolution-friendly clauses) across all derivative agreements so counterparties cannot automatically terminate or demand margin if the CIDI enters resolution. This mitigates a major escalation risk and meets FDIC expectations for orderly QFC unwinds.

**Current Deficit: No Single Repository for QFC Legal Agreements**  
• **Recommendation**: Establish a centralized contract management system that captures all QFC documents, including schedules, annexes, and addendums. By integrating legal, risk, and operational data in one place, the bank can quickly identify contractual terms (e.g., triggers, notice requirements) under stress.

(Optional) **Current Deficit: No Process To Identify and Remediate Cross-Default or Automatic Termination Clauses**  
• **Recommendation**: Create a formal review process—led by legal and risk—to pinpoint clauses that could accelerate liabilities upon the bank’s or affiliate’s resolution. Define standard resolution-friendly language and timelines for renegotiation, ensuring each contract aligns with FDIC QFC guidelines.



**Current Deficit: No Resolution-Favorable QFC Protocol in ISDA Agreements**  
• **Recommendation**: Incorporate the QFC Protocol provisions into existing and newly negotiated ISDA agreements so that counterparties cannot prematurely exercise default or termination rights if the CIDI enters resolution. Ensuring resolution-friendly language mitigates collateral calls and margin obligations triggered by a resolution scenario, reducing the risk of a disorderly unwind of derivatives.

**Current Deficit: Lack of Standard Resolution-Focused Protections Across Derivative Contracts**  
• **Recommendation**: Amend all QFC documentation (including ISDAs and other derivative agreements) to include QFC Protocol standards and resolution-focused clauses (e.g., limiting automatic termination upon a CIDI default). This uniform approach reduces the likelihood of abrupt exposure escalation in a failure scenario and aligns with FDIC expectations for managing derivative liabilities in resolution.
