While an inter‐affiliate financial exposure analysis focuses on funding and credit arrangements, it can overlook a range of non‐financial dependencies that are equally vital. For instance, the parent might supply skilled personnel or operational support that a core business line relies on for day‐to‐day activities. The parent may also provide established branding or intangible assets that help the business line attract and retain customers. Similarly, shared technology platforms or overarching risk‐management frameworks may be centrally maintained, offering critical infrastructure. And in many firms, a referral network from other parts of the group drives significant customer flow and revenue. Each of these illustrates how, beyond capital flows, the parent or an affiliate can deliver critical “value” that a purely financial analysis would miss.
