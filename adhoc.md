We do not recommend deleting the entire section and just stating that we don't have unsecured creditors (even if that is the case) as the regulatory text requires that banks document what systems are in place for identifying all unsecured non-deposit creditors at the CIDI. Regulators want to ensure that any potential non-deposit claim can be accurately identified and managed in a resolution scenario. So even if you have none today, in a potential resolution scenario down the road, you may have them. That's why the FDIC is looking for a "system" to keep track of them so that it knows what to do.
