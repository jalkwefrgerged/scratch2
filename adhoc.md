**Current Deficit: No Contingency Funding Plan Coverage for National Trust (a Material Entity)**  
• **Recommendation**: Integrate National Trust fully into the bank’s Contingency Funding Plan (CFP). This should include defined liquidity triggers, capital metrics, and escalation protocols tailored to National Trust’s operations, ensuring that any stress event at this material entity is promptly addressed within the broader resolution framework.
