**Potential Impediments to Resolution (Regulatory-Ready Narrative)**

CIBC Bank USA, in accordance with FDIC requirements, has conducted a comprehensive review of all potential factors that may materially impede its resolution. This assessment draws on extensive collaboration among senior management, risk management, operations, and compliance teams. It first highlights the bank’s reliance on third-party service providers for core banking platforms, digital banking operations, and cybersecurity. While these external partnerships offer operational efficiencies, they can pose continuity challenges in a resolution scenario. To address this risk, CIBC Bank USA ensures that service contracts include resolution-friendly clauses designed to maintain uninterrupted access to critical systems if the bank enters insolvency or receivership. The bank diligently documents these agreements, updating them regularly to confirm their ongoing validity. Alongside vendor management considerations, CIBC Bank USA also acknowledges that rapidly transitioning substantial commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loan portfolios may prove complex in a stressed environment. Despite these portfolios being well-documented and standardized, their sheer scale and significance to local economies could delay an orderly transfer. In anticipation of such challenges, the bank maintains contingency protocols, including pre-arranged virtual data rooms (VDRs) and standardized loan documentation, to streamline due diligence and support swift asset disposition if required. Furthermore, potential liquidity strains arising from the proportion of uninsured deposits also represent a key risk. Under stressed conditions, large-scale withdrawals by uninsured depositors could undermine stability. To mitigate such withdrawals, CIBC Bank USA conducts frequent stress testing, maintains robust liquidity buffers, and has established contingency funding strategies to reinforce its ability to meet depositor needs and sustain critical functions during resolution.

Beyond these established considerations, additional technological and process gaps have been identified that, if unaddressed, could significantly impede the bank’s ability to navigate a resolution scenario. Currently, there is no automated reporting tool for generating granular branch-level deposit data, including the segmentation of insured versus uninsured deposits across both domestic and foreign locations. This lack of automation can hamper prompt decision-making on deposit payouts and reduce transparency for regulators and depositors. Similarly, the bank relies on manual methods to gather critical data for regulatory memoranda like the Call Report RC-E, leading to potential delays and accuracy concerns under crisis conditions. Manual aggregation of key depositor information also risks obscuring deposit concentrations and run-off assumptions, while the absence of automated insured-versus-uninsured deposit validation could complicate FDIC insurance determinations. Moreover, the lack of a resolution-specific framework for identifying and managing critical shared services, including a formal taxonomy of those services, introduces ambiguity in prioritizing essential functions during a crisis. A related challenge involves the classification and tracking of Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs). Without consistent, resolution-friendly provisions and robust oversight, these contracts could trigger defaults or legal disputes in a stressed scenario. The bank similarly recognizes gaps in treasury management and capital structure tracking—especially around inter-affiliate funding and liabilities—that could produce incomplete or misleading liquidity estimates. These limitations may slow or prevent the rapid mobilization of necessary capital during resolution. Additionally, the absence of a centralized repository or Virtual Data Room for franchise components can impede timely divestitures or sales of business units, while insufficient oversight of shared contracts and cross-entity guarantees with the parent company may add legal and operational barriers to a swift separation.

CIBC Bank USA is actively remediating each of these issues to enhance its resolution readiness. Initiatives under way include automating deposit reporting processes, introducing integrated data-collection systems for regulatory filings, and consolidating key depositor and franchise information into an updated management information system (MIS) environment. These efforts aim to reduce reliance on manual workflows and ensure that mission-critical data—ranging from branch-specific deposits to QFC details—is both current and accessible. Concurrently, the bank is formalizing a resolution-specific framework for identifying and categorizing critical services to clarify which functions must be preserved during a resolution and how they interface with broader shared-service agreements. In parallel with these upgrades, CIBC Bank USA continues to refine its liquidity risk management practices, including more precise tracking of capital composition and inter-affiliate funding exposures, to ensure that contingency strategies remain robust and up to date. Taken together, these actions—along with the bank’s existing safeguards in vendor contracts, asset-transfer protocols, and deposit management—demonstrate a holistic commitment to mitigating any impediments to an orderly resolution. By strengthening governance around critical data, automating key processes, and reinforcing contingency planning, CIBC Bank USA remains focused on safeguarding its operational continuity and market stability, thereby fulfilling its regulatory obligations and preserving public confidence under even the most challenging conditions.
