**Current Deficit: Inadequate Treasury Management and Liquidity Forecasting Processes**  
• **Recommendation**: Implement a centralized treasury management platform that explicitly includes resolution-specific triggers (distinct from general Contingency Funding Plan triggers) and integrates capital metrics alongside liquidity forecasts. This ensures comprehensive and proactive tracking of funding and capital needs under stress.

**Current Deficit: Insufficient Comprehensive Liability Composition Analysis**  
• **Recommendation**: Enhance the existing liability management system to deliver an enterprise-wide view of each liability’s type, maturity, secured/unsecured status, contractual features (e.g., call rights, indenture trustees), and any public issuance details. This robust, automated profile supports resolution planning and meets regulatory requirements for accurate liability reporting.

**Current Deficit: National Trust Coverage Omission**  
• **Recommendation**: Expand both the treasury management and liability composition systems to explicitly include National Trust, recognizing it as a material entity. Ensure all forecasting, capital metrics, and liability categorizations incorporate National Trust’s data, so no critical exposures or funding needs are overlooked in a resolution scenario.
