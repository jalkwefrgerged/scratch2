While an inter‐affiliate financial exposure analysis captures the capital and funding flows between the bank and its parent or affiliates, it often omits non‐financial sources of support that significantly affect a business line’s operations. For instance, the parent might grant the core business line access to its proprietary software or specialized IT infrastructure, license a well‐recognized brand name that helps the business line win and retain customers, or offer marketing and distribution channels the line relies on for sales growth. Likewise, affiliates may handle key back‐office functions like HR or regulatory compliance, or provide a steady stream of cross‐referrals if they manage large customer relationships elsewhere in the group. If these resources are critical to how a business line generates revenue or retains customers, they represent real “value drawn” from the parent or affiliate—regardless of whether they involve any direct financial exposure.
