This content provided to fully address the requirements outlined in this ruleset and provide a level of detail consistent with peer institutions. Specifically, the FDIC expects banks to clearly identify hedging transactions that qualify for hedge accounting, describe hedges associated with core business lines, and outline the bank’s practices and reporting capabilities related to hedge accounting and other end-user hedges. Including explicit references to relevant accounting standards—such as ASC 815—helps regulators verify precisely how these hedges are identified, monitored, and reported, enabling them to clearly understand the bank’s accounting practices. Providing this level of detail demonstrates the bank’s operational readiness to effectively manage hedging exposures during a potential resolution scenario, ensuring transparency, consistency, and alignment with both regulatory expectations and established industry practices.
