In compliance with the regulatory requirement outlined by the FDIC, CIBC Bank USA has conducted an extensive and detailed internal assessment to identify activities that provide services or functions materially significant either regionally, within specific business sectors, or to other financial institutions. The bank primarily engages in commercial banking and wealth management services, as well as specialized fund finance activities. Through careful review and validation involving senior management, risk officers, business line executives, and operational leads, we have identified critical areas requiring comprehensive consideration in our resolution planning.

CIBC Bank USA maintains a substantial market presence in commercial banking, notably in commercial lending and treasury management services targeted at middle-market clients throughout Illinois and the broader Midwest region. Our commercial loan portfolio, consisting predominantly of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and commercial real estate (CRE) financing, plays an essential role in supporting regional economic activity. Recognizing the systemic importance of these functions, the bank has proactively engaged in rigorous contingency planning, developing extensive documentation, and establishing pre-arranged data rooms that would expedite the transferability of these loan portfolios and client accounts. Additionally, our internal review confirmed that numerous other regional and national banks have the capacity and requisite expertise to seamlessly assume these commercial banking relationships, ensuring minimal disruption to market operations and client service continuity in a resolution scenario.

Furthermore, CIBC Bank USA delivers specialized wealth management services, including tailored investment management, fiduciary services, and customized lending solutions, primarily targeting high-net-worth individuals, families, and institutional clients across the United States. These services significantly contribute to the financial stability and continuity of their respective client segments. To ensure robust mitigation against potential disruptions, our bank maintains comprehensive and securely accessible records, client agreements, and investment documentation in advanced digital formats. These preparations facilitate the rapid and seamless transition of assets under management (AUM) and client relationships to alternative fiduciaries or wealth management providers if necessary. Additionally, our ongoing dialogue with potential acquiring institutions—including national and regional banks as well as specialized wealth management firms—reinforces the readiness and substitutability of our wealth management services, ensuring continuity for our clients even under challenging resolution conditions.

CIBC Bank USA also provides specialized subscription credit facilities under our fund finance operations, primarily serving private equity and venture capital firms nationwide. These capital call facilities represent a critical source of liquidity and support to financial institutions and investment funds. Given the standardized and well-documented nature of these facilities, coupled with their inherently short-term structure, the bank’s fund finance activities are positioned for straightforward transfer or timely refinancing by other qualified institutions. Furthermore, an active and liquid secondary market exists for these subscription credit facilities, providing an additional layer of assurance that the termination of this particular business line would neither disrupt market operations nor diminish overall market liquidity.

The comprehensive internal assessment underpinning this response involved extensive consultation across various internal stakeholders, including senior management, business line leaders, compliance officers, legal teams, and IT operations. Stakeholders have confirmed operational capabilities, verified competitive market positions, and validated the substitutability and mitigation strategies in place. Moreover, this cross-functional collaboration ensures that potential operational dependencies—such as IT infrastructure, critical vendor contracts, and human resource continuity—have been thoroughly evaluated, documented, and prepared for expedited transition or substitution.

In conclusion, while the identified material activities of CIBC Bank USA hold significant roles within their respective markets and client sectors, they are strategically structured and meticulously documented to minimize systemic impact in resolution. Each identified area demonstrates substantial substitutability and is supported by robust, tested mitigation strategies. Therefore, the bank confidently asserts that any potential termination of these activities in a resolution scenario can be effectively managed to maintain market stability, safeguard client interests, and ensure minimal disruption to sectors and regional economic ecosystems.
