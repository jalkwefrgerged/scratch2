Below are the key QFC-related gaps **not** addressed in your current list of three, each framed in the format we’ve been using:

---


**Current Deficit: No Single Repository for QFC Legal Agreements**  
• **Recommendation**: Establish a centralized contract management system that captures all QFC documents, including schedules, annexes, and addendums. By integrating legal, risk, and operational data in one place, the bank can quickly identify contractual terms (e.g., triggers, notice requirements) under stress.

**Current Deficit: Lack of Resolution-Focused Protections Across All QFC Agreements**  
• **Recommendation**: Amend all ISDA and non-ISDA derivative contracts to incorporate QFC Protocol standards or similar resolution-friendly clauses (e.g., limiting automatic termination on a CIDI default). This uniform approach prevents premature exercise of default rights, mitigates margin or collateral escalation, and aligns with FDIC expectations for orderly QFC handling in a resolution scenario.
