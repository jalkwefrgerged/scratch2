CIBC Bank USA (“the Bank”) maintains a resolution-ready virtual data room (VDR) designed for rapid deployment in the event of material financial distress or failure, with clear governance, robust testing, and strong data validation processes. The Bank’s Board-approved Resolution Planning Team (RPT) stands at the core of these capabilities, supported by functional experts from Finance, IT, Legal, and Risk. Authorization to initiate VDR setup resides with the Chief Resolution Officer (CRO) under the Crisis Management Group, which convenes if internal early-warning indicators (e.g., liquidity triggers or supervisory downgrades) signal a potential resolution scenario. This structure ensures immediate coordination among all stakeholders if the Bank’s condition begins to deteriorate.

The Bank has integrated a detailed timeline showing how VDR activation can occur within 24–48 hours of escalation. In practice, deposit, loan, and financial data can be uploaded in parallel. For instance, deposit records and relevant carve-out financial statements are typically ready in a day, while larger, more complex data sets—like corporate-level GL extracts and specialized commercial loan tapes—may need two to three days. The Bank accounts for the possibility of a more accelerated failure by overlapping tasks, limiting certain reconciliation steps if needed, and employing “live updates” to the VDR to allow prospective bidders to see newly added or revised information in near real time.

The Bank conducts regular VDR testing and dry runs—currently scheduled semiannually—to confirm that data extraction scripts, folder structures, and user access protocols remain robust under high-pressure circumstances. These drills practice automated pulls from multiple systems (including deposit platforms, loan origination software, and general ledger modules) as well as manual reviews by data stewards in each line of business. Testing has helped identify bottlenecks, such as competing system loads during end-of-quarter close, and the Bank’s IT team has implemented technical adjustments (e.g., off-peak data dumps, cloud processing capacity) to address them. The Bank documents its test outcomes and any remediation steps in internal memos that become part of the resolution planning record, demonstrating continuous improvement toward resolution readiness.

Quality assurance and data validation procedures involve multiple layers. Each business unit’s data steward cross-checks extracted files against the Bank’s current general ledger or other authoritative source to verify completeness and accuracy. Should any material discrepancies arise, a separate Data Integrity Team works quickly to reconcile them before uploading. All data sets in the VDR are date-stamped and cross-referenced to show the point-in-time nature of each upload, minimizing confusion in a fast-moving scenario. Meanwhile, the Bank manages an error log so that any bidder or FDIC question about data anomalies can be formally recorded, addressed, and resolved in a transparent manner. The Bank’s goal is to give potential acquirers high-confidence data—especially for major franchise components like Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Private/Personal/Digital Banking, and the Treasury liquid asset portfolio.

In recognition that crises rarely follow an ideal path, the Bank has laid out fallback and redundancy measures. Its VDR is backed by cloud-based storage in geographically diverse data centers to mitigate local outages or cybersecurity events. If the designated VDR lead is unavailable, a cross-trained deputy in the Resolution Planning Team can step in, with system credentials and the same administrative rights. The Bank stores nightly backups of essential data sets (deposit ledger, loan portfolio extracts, carve-out financial statements, and HR data) so that VDR activation is not compromised by any single server failure. In short, the Bank has tested ways to keep the VDR operational and up-to-date even under stressed conditions.

Particular attention is given to third-party and external vendors. CIBC Bank USA relies on several technology providers for core processing and commercial loan servicing. The Bank’s service-level agreements include “critical event clauses” that oblige vendors to expedite data requests. These contractual provisions have been tested for performance under short deadlines and reflect the Bank’s contingency planning for rapid migration of any externally hosted loan or deposit data into the VDR. To further guard against disruptions, the Bank’s Legal department regularly reviews and updates contractual terms with key vendors to ensure no termination or access restrictions would prevent the Bank (or the FDIC as receiver) from retrieving essential data.

To protect confidentiality while also facilitating swift FDIC and bidder review, the Bank configures the VDR with strict role-based permissions. Administrators, which include the CRO and designated FDIC personnel (upon appointment as receiver), have full access, while prospective bidders receive read-only access to specific folders—thereby preserving data integrity. The Bank also implements watermarks, user activity logs, and a built-in Q&A module to handle bidder inquiries and maintain a real-time audit trail of disclosures. Where needed, the Bank can segregate or mask personally identifiable information in employee data sets to comply with privacy obligations. This careful approach ensures all relevant parties can swiftly conduct due diligence without breaching consumer privacy laws or other legal constraints.

Because the Bank’s resolution plan contemplates multiple resolution strategies, including a bridge bank approach or a multiple-acquirer breakup of specific franchise components, the VDR folder structure is segmented for each core business or product line. For example, all materials relevant to Private/Personal/Digital Banking are consolidated into a single subfolder, featuring carve-out financials, deposit rosters, and associated employee org charts. This segmentation helps potential acquirers make targeted inquiries while simplifying how the FDIC might pursue distinct sales of separate components. Should the FDIC desire to move the entire VDR to its own platform, the Bank maintains standardized exports with consistent naming conventions so the FDIC can import the content into a separate environment in as little as 48 hours.

Finally, the Bank ensures integration with its broader resolution strategy. The VDR complements the Bank’s communications playbook by providing relevant marketing documents or briefing decks so the FDIC can engage prospective bidders immediately after failure. If the FDIC proceeds with an all-deposits bridge bank strategy, the Bank’s already-segmented data sets facilitate quick asset and deposit valuations and diligence. If a multiple-acquirer exit unfolds, the Bank has documented how each group of business lines (Commercial Banking vs. Private Banking vs. Treasury portfolio) could be carved out, with electronic files labeled to show which entity or region they belong to. This alignment shows that the VDR stands not in isolation, but as a vital enabler of the Bank’s entire resolution plan.

Collectively, these measures provide a strong foundation for demonstrating CIBC Bank USA’s resolution readiness. The Bank’s approach—covering governance, well-defined timelines, testing and validation, contingency planning, vendor coordination, data security controls, and synergy with the overall resolution strategy—ensures the FDIC can market and consummate a sale of the franchise or any of its components on a rapid timetable that meets statutory least-cost requirements. By practicing these procedures through frequent drills and documenting them rigorously, the Bank maintains confidence that, in a potential failure, it can promptly stand up and maintain a comprehensive, accurate, and easily navigable VDR that fosters an efficient and competitive bidding process.
