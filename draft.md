Here's a revised assessment and an enhanced narrative with more detailed placeholders to clearly guide stakeholders in addressing all aspects of the regulatory requirements comprehensively:

### **Assessment of Current Narrative Against Regulation:**

- **Unsecured Creditors Identification Capabilities:**  
  - ✅ Clearly described current sources and processes (Letters of Credit and Capital Markets reporting).
  - **Gap:** The narrative currently does not explicitly describe how the bank captures or verifies creditor details such as addresses and the identity of indenture trustees.

### **Enhanced Narrative (with Detailed Placeholders):**

**Non-Depositor Unsecured Claims Identification Narrative**  
**CIBC Bank USA**  
**Date:** [INSERT DATE]

---

**I. Introduction**

This document describes CIBC Bank USA’s systems, processes, and recordkeeping practices used to identify and track unsecured creditors who are not depositors at the parent (CIDI) level. It is prepared as part of our full resolution submission in compliance with the FDIC’s resolution planning regulation. [INSERT SPECIFIC REGULATORY CITATION]

---

**II. Overview of Systems and Processes**

CIBC Bank USA employs an integrated Credit Risk Management (CRM) framework designed to identify unsecured creditors using the Correspondent Net Exposure Report, which aggregates data, calculates correspondent exposures, and concentration ratios.

This report is produced monthly using automated data feeds from internal systems, such as the Letters of Credit (LC) department and Capital Markets operations. The CRM team supplements these automated outputs with manual reviews of the Trade Schedule for Letters of Credit exposures and the Capital Markets Schedule for derivatives. Data accuracy and consistency are ensured by cross-referencing with internal platforms [INSERT OTHER SYSTEM NAMES, e.g., ACBS, PrivateLink].

Unsecured creditor data is reviewed monthly by the Chief Credit Officer and quarterly by the Correspondent Risk Committee. Verified data is securely stored on a shared drive managed by Credit Risk Management, allowing quick and secure access in a resolution scenario. [INSERT additional details, e.g., frequency and method of data backup, any physical backup storage locations, disaster recovery protocols.]

---

**III. Identification of Unsecured Creditors**

At the parent (CIDI) level, unsecured creditors are identified through two primary components within the Correspondent Net Exposure Report: Trade Schedule (Letters of Credit) and Capital Markets Schedule (derivative exposures).

The **Trade Schedule** captures unsecured credit exposures via unsecured lines of credit currently established with counterparties such as CIBC Canada and US Bank for confirming Letters of Credit issued by CIBC Bank USA. When these letters are drawn, the LC team confirms funds availability through dedicated deposit accounts set up specifically for these transactions. [INSERT specific procedural details about the exact process flow, thresholds, approvals required before LCs issuance, how exposures are specifically flagged, and examples of reports used.]

CIBC Bank USA does not have material subsidiaries; thus, identification efforts focus solely at the parent institution (CIDI).

---

**II. Recordkeeping Practices and Data Management**

All unsecured debt records—including the Correspondent Net Exposure Report, Letters of Credit documentation, and Capital Markets derivative exposures—are digitally stored on a secured shared drive managed by Credit Risk Management. Access is strictly limited to authorized personnel to ensure security, confidentiality, and integrity. Records are available immediately in a resolution scenario through established secure access protocols. [INSERT detailed description of security measures, backups frequency, responsible personnel, contingency planning, disaster recovery processes.]

Regarding inter-creditor agreements, [INSERT detailed description explicitly stating either (a) the presence of inter-creditor agreements, describing the nature, recordkeeping location (digital or physical), method of updating these records, review schedules, and audit controls, OR (b) a clear statement indicating if no such agreements exist, and how the bank would manage such agreements if they were introduced.]

---

**III. Detailed Creditor Identification Capabilities**

CIBC Bank USA’s systems are designed to comprehensively capture the following critical data elements for each unsecured creditor:

- **Name:** The creditor’s full legal entity name, as it appears in contractual documents. [INSERT detailed procedure or system name that explicitly tracks creditor names, e.g., “Credit Risk Management’s Correspondent Net Exposure Report” or similar internal system.]
  - Example: “XYZ Capital Partners, LLC.”

- **Address:** Complete and up-to-date address of each creditor. [INSERT specific procedural steps to obtain, verify, and periodically update creditor addresses, e.g., through periodic creditor verification processes, third-party services, or internal audits.]
  - Example: "1234 Market Street, Suite 500, Anytown, USA 12345."

- **Nature of Liability:** Clear categorization of unsecured liabilities, distinguishing between Letters of Credit, derivative exposures, unsecured notes, bonds, or other financial obligations. [INSERT process or definitions used internally to classify and track the nature of each liability.]
  - Example: "Unsecured Letter of Credit confirmation facility with CIBC Canada" or "Derivative exposure per CSA agreements."

- **Amount Owed:** Precise outstanding balance or potential commitment associated with each unsecured creditor. The Correspondent Net Exposure Report, Trade Schedule, and Collateral Snapshot report explicitly detail such balances monthly. [INSERT details on any additional reconciliation or validation procedures used to ensure accuracy.]

- **Indentured Securities (if applicable):** For any indentured securities, identification includes the trustee responsible for indentured securities. [INSERT detailed steps for capturing, updating, and verifying trustee information, including frequency of updates, verification sources, and responsible teams.]

---

**IV. Recordkeeping Practices**

Credit Risk Management, in coordination with Finance and Operations teams, maintains and updates creditor data monthly. Audit logs record every change to creditor records, and daily backups are performed alongside regular data integrity checks. [INSERT detailed description of additional recordkeeping protocols, including who is responsible for each task, frequency of audits, and reconciliation procedures.]

Regarding **inter-creditor agreements**:  
[INSERT detailed instructions to the bank:  
- Clearly state whether inter-creditor agreements currently exist at CIBC Bank USA.  
- If applicable, provide detailed instructions on how agreements are documented, updated, stored (e.g., electronically within the CRM secure shared drive), including examples such as “agreements stored digitally as PDFs within specific shared drive folders named ‘Inter-Creditor Agreements.’”  
- Describe the regular process and frequency for reviewing or auditing these agreements to ensure accurate and up-to-date records.]

---

**IV. Ongoing Monitoring and Change Management**

The Chief Credit Officer reviews the Correspondent Net Exposure Report monthly, and the Correspondent Risk Committee provides quarterly oversight. Capital Markets Operations monitors derivative exposures daily via MTM reconciliations.

CRM systems automatically notify relevant personnel about significant changes or discrepancies in unsecured creditor data. [INSERT additional detailed procedures about internal communication processes, system-generated alerts, escalation protocols, or responsibilities of key personnel in responding to identified discrepancies or significant changes.]

**V. Conclusion and Compliance Statement**

CIBC Bank USA’s established framework ensures robust identification, detailed tracking, and accurate reporting of unsecured creditors through an integrated CRM approach. The centralized storage on the secured shared drive managed by Credit Risk Management provides reliable access to records necessary in a resolution scenario.
