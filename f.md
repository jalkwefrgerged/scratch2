**Current Deficit: Inadequate Linkage Between Franchise Components and Supporting Data**  
• Deploy an integrated data architecture that systematically maps each franchise component to the relevant financial, contractual, and operational records—such as loan and deposit data, vendor agreements, bond indentures, and service-level agreements—in a single repository. This approach enables on-demand generation of due diligence materials without extensive manual effort, facilitating faster and more efficient marketing and sale of franchise components in a resolution scenario.

**Current Deficit: No Existing Virtual Data Room (VDR) Capability for Rapid, Comprehensive Data Disclosure**  
• Implement a secure, scalable VDR solution that can be quickly populated with financial statements, deposit data, loan information, and other due diligence materials. Standardize VDR processes and governance to define roles, responsibilities, and protocols for updating the VDR, and integrate automated data feeds from existing systems to minimize manual uploads and ensure real-time accuracy.


**Current Deficit: Difficulty Generating Targeted, On-Demand Reports for Franchise Components**  
• Implement a centralized reporting infrastructure that can quickly produce carve-out financial statements and other due diligence materials on a per-component basis (e.g., deposit trends, loan tapes, securities breakdowns), ensuring that these reports are both accurate and readily available for prospective bidders in a resolution scenario.

**Current Deficit: Lack of a Formal Process to Identify and Prioritize Franchise Components**  
• Establish a standardized methodology to identify, classify, and prioritize franchise components that are separable and marketable in a timely manner, including metrics to measure size, significance, and key senior management oversight.

**Current Deficit: Limited Capability for Rapid, Comprehensive Data Room Setup**  
• Implement a structured “virtual data room readiness” framework to ensure that all pertinent financial statements, deposit data, loan information, securities details, organizational structures, key employee data, material contracts, and critical services agreements can be promptly gathered and organized for prospective buyers in a resolution scenario.

**Current Deficit: Inadequate Linkage Between Franchise Components and Supporting Data**  
• Develop automated processes that clearly map each franchise component to its respective financials, contracts, and critical services, allowing for immediate due diligence materials to be generated from centralized systems.

**Current Deficit: Absence of Robust Management Oversight and Reporting for Franchise Component Marketing**  
• Create a governance structure—led by designated senior management officials—responsible for monitoring, updating, and reporting on the readiness, marketability, and overall status of each franchise component and the IDI franchise as a whole.
