**Gap: Incomplete Identification of PCS Service Providers**  
• Implement a centralized vendor management system to capture all direct relationships with payment, clearing, and settlement service providers, agent banks, and financial market utilities.

**Gap: Lack of Structured Mapping to Business Entities**  
• Develop automated processes to map each identified PCS service provider to the bank’s legal entities, core business lines, and franchise components.

**Gap: Insufficient Quantitative Analysis of PCS Service Metrics**  
• Deploy advanced reporting and analytics tools to capture and report the value and volume of PCS services provided on a per-provider basis.

**Gap: Undefined Internal Role as a PCS Service Provider**  
• Establish systems and processes to track and quantify the bank’s own role as a PCS service provider, including its revenue contributions and value to core business lines or franchise components.
