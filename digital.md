**Current Deficit: No Formal Process to Identify and Catalog Digital Services**  
• Establish a repeatable, governance-driven method to list every customer-facing digital platform, specify which entity (CIDI, subsidiary, affiliate, or third party) provides or owns the IP/license, and maintain this information in a centralized repository for resolution planning.

**Current Deficit: Lack of an Ongoing Review Framework for IP Ownership and Licensing**  
• Develop a structured review cycle—supported by legal and technology teams—to evaluate any new or modified digital service agreements (including third-party or affiliate licenses), ensuring resolution scenarios (e.g., transfer or termination) are accounted for before finalizing contracts.

**Current Deficit: No Process for Assessing Impact on Franchise Value and Depositor Behavior**  
• Implement an analytical process—potentially involving customer data analysis, usage metrics, and revenue attribution—that regularly evaluates how each digital service influences the CIDI’s core operations, depositor loyalty, and overall franchise value. This approach should be documented and repeatable, enabling clear insights in a resolution scenario.
