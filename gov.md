**Current Deficit: Absence of a Centralized Stakeholder Categorization System**  
• Establish a database or registry to catalog each stakeholder category (e.g., regulators, customers, counterparties, personnel), detailing local vs. cross-border requirements and mapping them to the bank’s crisis communication plans.

**Current Deficit: No Documented Process for Selecting and Managing Communication Channels**  
• Create a channel management framework that outlines each channel’s suitability and constraints—technical, geographical, regulatory—ensuring the bank can effectively reach all stakeholder segments, including those in foreign jurisdictions.

**Current Deficit: Lack of Automated Contact List Generation**  
• Implement a contact management solution that regularly synchronizes with HR, customer, and vendor databases, providing real-time, ready-to-generate lists for each stakeholder group. Include a documented estimate of the time required to compile each list in an emergency.

**Current Deficit: Uncoordinated Communication Across Channels and Stakeholder Categories**  
• Develop a formal, multi-channel communication workflow—potentially supported by a communication hub—that synchronizes messaging across all channels and time zones, including cross-border authorities, ensuring consistent, simultaneous outreach in a crisis.

**Current Deficit: Undefined Roles and Responsibilities for Crisis Communications**  
• Implement a governance directory or tool that designates, by role or title, who is responsible for crisis communication to each stakeholder group and channel. Ensure this directory is automatically updated to reflect organizational changes and remains accessible during resolution events.
