Current Deficit: No Formal Shared Services Taxonomy or Governance Framework
• Establish a structured, bank-wide system to categorize and document shared services (e.g., IT, HR, accounting, legal) – detailing which business lines or entities each service supports, the ownership of those services (bank vs. non-bank affiliate), and any relevant contracts or SLAs. This taxonomy should be governed by a recurring review and update process to ensure resolution planners can easily map services to franchise components or material entities and maintain continuity or transfer in a stress scenario.
