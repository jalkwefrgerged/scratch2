Inadequate Tracking and Classification of Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs) and Associated Risks: Implement an integrated QFC management system that identifies, classifies, and tracks all QFC transactions—including customer and counterparty details, notional amounts, and associations with core business lines and franchise components.
Fragmented Booking Model Processes for Derivative Transactions: Develop and deploy a centralized derivative risk booking platform that captures various booking models (global risk book, remote bookings, back-to-back), integrates with risk management systems, and monitors both customer-facing and dealer-facing risks.
Insufficient Processes for Using QFCs in Hedging and Liquidity Management: Establish a comprehensive hedging and liquidity management framework that documents how QFCs are used to hedge specific exposures (cash flow, assets, liabilities) across core business lines, with automated risk reporting and mitigation tracking.
Lack of Robust Hedge Accounting Reporting and Segmentation: Implement advanced financial reporting and analytics tools to segregate and report hedges that receive hedge accounting treatment versus core business line–specific hedges, ensuring timely, accurate, and detailed regulatory reporting.
