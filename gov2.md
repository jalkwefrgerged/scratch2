**Current Deficit: Inadequate Integration of Resolution Planning Into Corporate Governance**  
• Develop a formal governance framework that ensures resolution planning is consistently included in senior management and board-level discussions. This framework should assign accountability for monitoring resolution-related milestones, reviewing plan assumptions, and integrating feedback from oversight committees.

**Current Deficit: No Documented Policies, Procedures, and Internal Controls for Resolution Plan Preparation**  
• Establish detailed, board-approved policies and procedures that govern the creation, review, and approval of the full resolution submission. These should define how data is collected, verified, and incorporated, as well as the internal controls that ensure the plan meets regulatory standards.

**Current Deficit: Unclear Accountability and Ownership of the Resolution Plan**  
• Designate a senior management official (by title and functional role) who has explicit responsibility for the development, maintenance, and filing of the resolution submission. Document this individual’s authority to coordinate with all necessary internal departments and certify compliance with the FDIC’s requirements.
