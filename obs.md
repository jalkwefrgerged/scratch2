**Current Deficit: No Ongoing Data Refresh Cycle for Off-Balance-Sheet Exposures**  
• Establish a scheduled reconciliation process (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to ensure newly issued guarantees or changes to unfunded commitments are promptly captured, validated, and mapped to the correct core business lines or franchise components. This minimizes the risk of outdated or incomplete exposure data in a resolution scenario.  

**Current Deficit: Lack of Standardized Exposure Classification and Criteria**  
• Develop a formal classification system that clearly defines the threshold for “material” off-balance-sheet exposures—using metrics such as financial impact, counterparty risk, and strategic significance. Consistently applying these criteria across all operating units ensures no liabilities are overlooked or underreported when the bank is under stress.  

**Current Deficit: No On-Demand Capability to Identify and Map Off-Balance-Sheet Exposures**  
• Implement a resolution-ready system that can quickly produce a consolidated list of all material off-balance-sheet commitments, guarantees, and contractual obligations, linking each exposure to the relevant core business line, franchise component, or material asset portfolio.
