### I. Introduction  
This document provides a comprehensive overview of CIBC Bank USA’s approach to identifying, monitoring, and managing all unsecured creditors who are not depositors at the parent insured depository institution (CIDI) level. It is submitted in accordance with the FDIC’s resolution planning regulation, which mandates that a full resolution submission describe how unsecured creditors are identified, where the records are maintained, and how each creditor can be tracked by name, address, nature of liability, and amount owed. Because CIBC Bank USA does not have any material subsidiaries, the scope of this narrative focuses exclusively on the parent CIDI.

The primary goal of this requirement is to ensure that in the event of a resolution, regulators and other stakeholders can efficiently locate and verify all claims of non-depositor unsecured creditors. This capability is fundamental to preserving market confidence, mitigating systemic risk, and allowing for a swift and orderly resolution process that prioritizes creditor protection and financial stability.

### II. Overview of Systems and Processes  
CIBC Bank USA uses an integrated Credit Risk Management (CRM) framework that consolidates exposure data into a monthly Correspondent Net Exposure Report. This report aggregates information from multiple internal sources, including the Letters of Credit (LC) Department and Capital Markets Operations, and provides a consolidated view of both secured and unsecured exposures. The CRM team reviews these data feeds and compares them against established thresholds to track potential vulnerabilities within the institution’s credit portfolio. To illustrate how these data flows are collected, verified, and reported, the bank has developed a process flowchart that visually depicts the departmental interactions, data transfer routines, and control points (for example, approvals and reconciliations).

All exposure data is cross-referenced with internal systems for completeness and accuracy. ACBS captures loan and letters of credit commitments, while PrivateLink houses International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements and corresponding Credit Support Annexes (CSAs). Each month, the Chief Credit Officer reviews the Correspondent Net Exposure Report to ensure compliance with approved limits and ongoing visibility into unsecured obligations. On a quarterly basis, the Correspondent Risk Committee further evaluates this report, providing an additional level of oversight and governance.

In support of these processes, the bank has prepared redacted examples of the key documents involved. These samples highlight a typical Correspondent Net Exposure Report, including how the Trade Schedule and Capital Markets Schedule appear in practice, as well as a Collateral Snapshot that outlines daily mark-to-market details for derivatives. Collectively, these examples underscore the breadth of data that underpins the bank’s unsecured creditor identification and monitoring.

To facilitate quick access in a resolution scenario, all validated records—ranging from the Net Exposure Report to Letters of Credit documentation and other supporting agreements—are stored on a dedicated shared drive managed by Credit Risk Management. This secure repository serves as a central location for parties who, in a resolution scenario, would require immediate and comprehensive information regarding non-depositor unsecured creditors.

### III. Identification of Unsecured Creditors  
CIBC Bank USA identifies non-depositor unsecured creditors primarily through two key components of the Correspondent Net Exposure Report: the Trade Schedule (focusing on Letters of Credit) and the Capital Markets Schedule (addressing derivative exposures).

Within the Trade Schedule, unsecured exposures result from Letters of Credit confirmed through unsecured lines of credit established with financial institution counterparties, currently including CIBC Canada and US Bank. When one of these lines is utilized, the Letters of Credit Department confirms that funds are available in a dedicated deposit account at the confirming bank to cover any draw. Before issuance of any Letter of Credit, the customer undergoes an internal credit approval process in the LP Vision system, and all approved commitments are recorded in ACBS. The total potential commitment is captured monthly in the Net Exposure Report, reflecting both outstanding LCs and any remaining capacity under the unsecured lines.

In the Capital Markets Schedule, derivative exposures are evaluated through a Collateral Snapshot report, prepared monthly by Capital Markets Operations. If mark-to-market (MTM) calculations indicate a negative exposure to CIBC Bank USA (e.g., where the bank may owe margin or funds to a counterparty), that exposure is considered unsecured and recorded in the Net Exposure Report for monthly review by the Chief Credit Officer. Trading counterparties are onboarded with formal ISDA Master Agreements and CSAs, which detail permissible collateral types, margin requirements, and other risk-management provisions. These documents are stored electronically in PrivateLink, ensuring that CIBC Bank USA can readily reference specific contractual obligations at any time.

### IV. Recordkeeping Practices and Data Management  
All unsecured debt records are maintained on a secure shared drive managed by Credit Risk Management. This electronic repository houses the Correspondent Net Exposure Report, Letters of Credit documentation, derivative exposure details, and any associated agreements or support documentation. To protect data integrity and confidentiality, the shared drive is safeguarded by strict user access controls, encryption, and multi-factor authentication.

Daily electronic backups are performed, with copies stored in an off-site data center designed for redundancy and disaster recovery. In the event of any major system disruption, CIBC Bank USA’s protocols ensure prompt retrieval of these backups, preserving uninterrupted access to critical data. IT audits and penetration tests are carried out periodically to confirm the adequacy of these controls. Any significant changes, such as new or modified unsecured exposure records, are subject to monthly verification processes to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compliance with internal policies.

In addition, the bank’s governance framework is supported by the CIBC Bank USA Correspondent Credit Risk Management Policy, which outlines specific thresholds for exposure limits and mandates routine reporting. Relevant excerpts from this policy confirm the frequency of exposure reporting, define the roles of oversight committees, and detail periodic audits. This policy-driven environment enhances CIBC Bank USA’s ability to remain consistent with both internal standards and regulatory expectations.

### V. Detailed Creditor Identification Capabilities  
CIBC Bank USA’s systems and processes collectively enable the institution to identify each non-depositor unsecured creditor by name, address, nature of the liability, and amount owed. The bank actively maintains each creditor’s legal name in ACBS or PrivateLink and ensures that addresses remain current through routine Know Your Customer (KYC) reviews or counterparty due diligence. The nature of the liability is designated as either a Letter of Credit obligation or a derivative exposure, with unsecured notes or bonds also classified when applicable, though the bank does not currently engage in significant issuance of such instruments. The amount owed is updated monthly within the Correspondent Net Exposure Report, augmented by daily MTM reconciliations for derivative exposures. Where indentured securities might be issued in the future, the identity of any indenture trustee would be captured in the same databases that manage all unsecured obligations.

### VI. Inter-Creditor Agreements  
At present, CIBC Bank USA does not maintain inter-creditor agreements for any unsecured debt. Should the bank enter into such arrangements in the future, the Legal and Credit Risk Management teams will store any executed agreements on the secured shared drive alongside other unsecured debt records and periodically review them for accuracy and completeness. This practice would ensure that a consolidated view of all obligations, including inter-creditor obligations, is immediately available in a resolution scenario.

---

### VII. Ongoing Monitoring and Change Management  
Ongoing oversight is conducted through monthly reviews by the Chief Credit Officer and quarterly evaluations by the Correspondent Risk Committee. In addition, Capital Markets Operations conducts daily MTM reconciliations for derivative exposures to capture any material changes to a counterparty’s unsecured exposure. If exposures increase significantly or discrepancies arise, automated alerts within the CRM framework prompt swift escalation to designated personnel who can address risk concerns or perform data validation.

Internal Audit and Compliance teams also review the bank’s unsecured creditor identification processes at least once per year. These reviews confirm that recordkeeping remains transparent, accurate, and consistent with both internal credit risk policies and federal regulatory standards. Any recommended improvements or identified issues are documented and remediated in accordance with established governance protocols.

### VIII. Conclusion and Compliance Statement  
CIBC Bank USA maintains a comprehensive program for identifying, documenting, and monitoring unsecured creditors that are not depositors, in strict compliance with the FDIC’s resolution planning regulation. Through its integrated systems and processes, the bank can identify each creditor by name, address, nature of liability, and amount owed, while ensuring that all related documentation is securely and centrally stored for rapid access in a resolution event. These measures support the FDIC’s broader objective of promoting an orderly resolution and reducing risks to the financial system by making all critical information about non-depositor unsecured creditors readily available.

By maintaining robust internal controls, daily exposure monitoring, and a reliable recordkeeping infrastructure, CIBC Bank USA stands ready to facilitate any resolution requirements in a timely and efficient manner. We affirm that this narrative accurately reflects the bank’s current practices and demonstrates CIBC Bank USA’s commitment to meeting all regulatory mandates for resolution planning.
