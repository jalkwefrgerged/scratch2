Below is a **sample template/outline** that banks can use to address the FDIC requirement for describing their contingency-planning exercises in a full resolution submission. The structure is deliberately formatted in a way that can be easily incorporated into your broader resolution plan documentation. You can tailor or expand each section based on your specific activities, governance practices, and internal formats.

---

## [SECTION TITLE:] Contingency Planning and Exercise Summary

### 1. Purpose and Scope
- **Purpose of this Section**  
  Briefly state that this section fulfills the FDIC requirement to describe the nature, extent, and results of any contingency-planning or similar exercises conducted since the most recent full resolution submission.  
- **Scope of Exercises**  
  Indicate the timeframe (e.g., “Exercises and assessments performed between [Date of Last Full Submission] and [Current Submission Date]”).

---

### 2. Description of Exercises Conducted
- **Exercise Name(s) and Date(s)**  
  - Provide the official name(s) or short descriptor of each exercise (e.g., “Liquidity Stress Simulation, Q2 2024 Tabletop Exercise, Cyber Resilience Drill”) and the date it was conducted.
- **Exercise Type**  
  - Characterize the exercise—e.g., tabletop simulation, stress test, crisis management drill, or targeted capability assessment.
- **Primary Objectives**  
  - Explain the main goals: e.g., testing bridge bank operations, evaluating MIS capabilities, enhancing deposit insurance determination readiness, etc.

**Example**:  
> “On August 15, 2024, the Bank conducted a half-day tabletop exercise focused on the rapid establishment of a bridge depository institution and the mechanics of transitioning critical services.”

---

### 3. Key Participants and Roles
- **Departments and Business Lines Involved**  
  - List all relevant teams (finance, treasury, legal, operations, IT, business continuity, risk management).  
- **Executive Sponsorship**  
  - Note whether board members or senior leadership were engaged.  
- **External Stakeholders (If Applicable)**  
  - State if regulators, external advisors, or partner entities took part in or observed the exercise.

---

### 4. Methodology and Scenario(s) Tested
- **Scenario Design**  
  - Briefly describe the macroeconomic or firm-specific assumptions used in the exercise—e.g., liquidity stress, sudden deposit run, critical IT outage, or capital shortfall.  
- **Execution Approach**  
  - Explain the steps taken to simulate or test contingency measures (including any data pulls, role-play sessions, or technology system checks).

**Example**:  
> “The tabletop simulation began with a hypothetical 30% drawdown of uninsured deposits over a three-day period, followed by a rapid transition to a bridge bank scenario.”

---

### 5. Results and Observations
- **Key Findings**  
  - Summarize main takeaways (e.g., strengths in MIS reporting, challenges in data room readiness, success in bridging critical operations).  
- **Identified Gaps or Deficiencies**  
  - Note any weaknesses discovered—this is critical for transparency and improvement.  
  - Examples: slow retrieval of loan-level data, unclear responsibilities for third-party vendor oversight, or lack of complete deposit account contact info.

---

### 6. Remediation Actions and Follow-Up
- **Action Items**  
  - For each gap, briefly discuss the plan to address it (e.g., system upgrade, process change, staff training).  
- **Owners and Timelines**  
  - Indicate who (department/manager) is responsible and by when the improvement should be completed.  
- **Progress Updates**  
  - If certain remedial steps are already underway or completed, summarize the status.

**Example**:  
> - **Gap**: Delays in preparing a virtual data room (VDR).  
> - **Action**: Implement an automated file categorization tool.  
> - **Owner**: IT Department, Program Management Office.  
> - **Timeline**: Completion by Q1 2025.

---

### 7. Impact on the Identified Strategy (If Required)
> *Note: This subsection is primarily for Group A CIDIs or other institutions that must provide an identified resolution strategy.*  
- **Confirmation or Adjustment to Identified Strategy**  
  - State whether the exercise results validated or led to any refinements in the official identified resolution strategy.  
- **Lessons Applied to Strategy**  
  - Describe changes or clarifications in your bridge bank approach, multiple-acquirer exit strategy, or insured-deposit transfer assumptions—whatever is relevant to your core plan.

**Example**:  
> “Results reaffirmed the viability of our bridge bank strategy but highlighted the need for enhanced cross-functional coordination in the first 48 hours after failure notification.”

---

### 8. Other Relevant Contingency Measures
- **Additional Risk Mitigants**  
  - If the exercise exposed other vulnerabilities requiring new contingency measures, mention these here.  
- **Future Exercises**  
  - List any upcoming or planned drills, or continuous-improvement activities.

---

### 9. Conclusion and Sign-Off
- **Overall Assessment**  
  - Provide a high-level statement on how the exercises strengthen or inform the bank’s readiness for resolution.  
- **Governance Approval**  
  - Mention if the board or relevant committee has reviewed and approved the exercise findings and follow-up measures (or plans to).

**Example**:  
> “The Board’s Risk Committee reviewed and approved the contingency-exercise report during its October 2024 meeting, confirming alignment with the Bank’s resolution readiness objectives.”

---

## APPENDIX (Optional)
- **Supporting Evidence**  
  - Attach or reference detailed exercise scripts, after-action reports, or summary decks.  
- **List of Acronyms**  
  - Provide clarifications if needed.

### Final Tips

1. **Keep It Realistic and Aligned**: Ensure the documented exercises are truly relevant to your bank’s size, complexity, and resolution strategy.  
2. **Be Specific**: Vague discussions are less useful. The FDIC wants to see that your bank is actively testing and remediating.  
3. **Demonstrate Progress**: Even if you identified deficiencies, show how you’ve already taken meaningful steps to correct them.  

This structure provides FDIC reviewers with a coherent story: **what** you tested, **why** you did it, **what** you found, and **how** you’re improving. By following this outline, you can make your response both concise and robust.
