To be "resolution-ready" with respect to overall deposit activities, a bank must have a comprehensive suite of technology systems, processes, and governance controls in place. These systems and processes ensure that the bank can accurately and rapidly capture, aggregate, and report deposit-related information under various scenarios. Key requirements include:

### 1. Integrated Data Aggregation and Reporting Systems
• **Core Banking and Treasury Integration:** The bank must have a core banking system that captures detailed data on all deposit accounts, including insured versus uninsured deposits. This system should be fully integrated with treasury management and other financial platforms so that data from deposit sweep arrangements, omnibus accounts, and pass-through accounts is aggregated seamlessly.

• **Automated Reporting Tools:** Advanced reporting tools must be in place to automatically generate detailed reports. These reports should cover:
  - Overall deposit balances and breakdowns (insured/uninsured).
  - Foreign deposit data segmented by jurisdiction, including dual-payment percentages.
  - Deposit concentrations, showing how specific types or groups of deposits map to core business lines or franchise components.
  - Details on deposit sweep arrangements, including contractual terms and real-time reporting of sweep deposits, with minimal data lag.

### 2. Real-Time Data Capabilities and Dashboarding
• **Real-Time Analytics:** The institution should leverage real-time data aggregation and dashboard tools to monitor deposit flows and concentrations continuously. This enables the bank to quickly detect anomalies or shifts in depositor behavior that might signal operational or liquidity issues.

• **Key Depositor Identification:** The system should be capable of instantly generating reports on key depositors by integrating data from both core banking and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. This report must detail the depositor’s identity, deposit amount, related business segments, and associated services (such as lending, wealth management, brokerage, or custody).

### 3. Robust Process Controls and Data Quality Assurance
• **Standardized Data Collection Procedures:** Documented processes must be in place for the collection, validation, and reconciliation of deposit data. This includes periodic reviews and testing to ensure accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of the information reported.

• **Governance and Oversight:** A strong governance framework should oversee the management of deposit data, including clearly defined roles for IT, treasury, and risk management teams. Regular audits and validation checks help ensure that any changes—such as those arising from deposit sweep arrangements or changes in depositor behavior—are promptly identified and accurately reported.

### 4. Virtual Data Room (VDR) Readiness and Secure Data Management
• **Rapid Data Extraction and Migration:** The bank must be capable of swiftly populating a secure Virtual Data Room (VDR) with up-to-date deposit information if required by the FDIC during a resolution scenario. This requires both the technology to extract data in real time and the processes to verify and format the data for regulatory review.

• **Enhanced Security and Compliance:** Systems must comply with industry and regulatory standards to protect sensitive depositor information. This includes robust cybersecurity measures and access controls to prevent unauthorized data access.

### 5. Process Efficiency and Timeliness
• **Quick Report Generation:** The bank should have automated mechanisms to generate and update reports on deposit activity and key depositors. It must be able to demonstrate that it can produce these reports within a defined, short turnaround time—ensuring that the FDIC always receives current information.

• **Minimization of Data Lag:** Reporting systems must be designed to minimize any delays between data capture and report generation. This is especially critical for high-frequency transactions like deposit sweeps, where even minor data lag could impact the accuracy of risk assessments.

### Summary
In essence, for a bank to be deemed "resolution-ready" under the FDIC regulation, it must integrate its core banking, treasury, and CRM systems into a centralized data aggregation and reporting framework. This framework should support real-time monitoring, quick and accurate report generation, and secure data management—all governed by well-documented processes and stringent oversight. Meeting these requirements will enable the bank to provide the FDIC with comprehensive, timely, and reliable deposit data as required in the resolution planning process.
