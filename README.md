**INVESTIGATION OUTCOME**  
Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) is filing a SAR on **BEATRIZ R. RAZON** and **JOSE DE JESUS CHÁVEZ PARRA** to report **structuring — multiple cash deposits apparently designed to evade the \$10 000 Currency Transaction Report threshold** between **03/18/2025 and 03/19/2025**, totaling **\$10 020**. The suspicious activity occurred at ATMs in Enfield, CT.  
Between 03/18/2025 and 03/19/2025 the following activity was observed: **3 deposit(s) totaling \$10 020**. The deposit(s) consisted of cash transactions. Amounts ranged from **\$320 to \$7 500**. Deposits were conducted via ATMs in Enfield, CT.  

**Suspicious Activity Summary & Support**  
* Three cash deposits (\$7 500 and \$2 200 on 03/18/2025; \$320 on 03/19/2025) were placed at the same ATM within a 48-hour window and together exceed the \$10 000 CTR threshold by \$20, indicating deliberate structuring.  
* An additional high-value cash credit of **\$10 020 on 03/28/2025** shows the pattern persisted beyond the structuring cluster.  
* Over the 120-day look-back the account received approximately **\$43 801 in cash credits versus \$2 860 in ACH credits**, inconsistent with the customers’ stated low-wage employment.  
* Outflows are primarily routine ACH debits; cheque activity is minimal, limited to two on-us cheques to **BCI Financial Corporation for \$611.32 each on 02/01/2025 and 04/24/2025**. No significant outgoing payments or business-related expenses appear.
