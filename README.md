### Consolidated Summary of Key HR and Off-Balance Sheet Exposure Components

## HR Role and Responsibilities:
- **Risk Identification:** HR identifies people-related risks but is not responsible for developing or executing mitigation strategies.
- **Framework Provider:** HR establishes frameworks and facilitates identifying key personnel alongside business units but does not make resource allocation or mitigation decisions.
- **Mitigation Execution:** Business lines and finance are accountable for executing mitigation strategies, such as retention incentives, hiring decisions, and compensation adjustments.

## Identification of Key Personnel:
- **Criteria for Selection:**
  - Job titles/functions
  - Compensation grade levels (e.g., Level 7 and above)
  - Legal employing entities
  - Location
  - Core business line affiliation
- **Importance:** Personnel essential for capital/liquidity management, executing critical resolution decisions, and maintaining franchise value.
- **HR Role:** HR provides the general framework; specific mitigation decisions remain with business units.

## FDIC Requirements and Expectations:
- Detailed rationale for identifying key roles, regularly refreshed lists.
- Clear documentation of methodology for employee retention approaches.

## Resolution and Business Continuity (BCM):
- **Scenario Distinction:** Resolution planning (long-term disruptions) differs from typical short-term BCM events.
- **Collaboration Required:** HR should coordinate with BCM teams to accurately identify long-term critical personnel.
- **BCM Management:** Primary BCM responsibility resides with the BCM team (not HR).

## Data and Reporting Limitations:
- Current HR systems (Workday) limitations necessitate broader, flexible descriptions rather than granular detail.
- Focus on automating updates and using role flags rather than specific employee names.

## Immediate HR Action Items:
- Update HR documentation to reflect FDIC-mandated details (titles, functions, locations, core lines, employing entities).
- Confirm accuracy of process diagrams, clarify governance roles, and remove redundant information.

## Off-Balance Sheet Exposure Reporting:
- **Consolidation at Bank Level:**
  - Provide aggregated off-balance sheet exposures at Bank USA level.
  - Use "X" to indicate alignment with core business lines rather than detailing values by franchise component.

- **Types of Exposures:**
  - Client-facing swaps (interest rate, FX).
  - Corresponding offsetting or hedging swaps clearly documented for netting clarity.

- **Netting and Documentation:**
  - Explicitly present both client-side and hedging swaps for transparency.
  - Provide narrative explanation of consolidated reporting rationale and netting methodology.

## Regulatory Compliance and Clarity:
- Clearly articulate exposure reporting methodology to satisfy FDIC requirements.
- Provide comparison context where applicable to industry peers.

## Immediate Finance Action Items:
- Update off-balance sheet exposure table to reflect consolidation approach.
- Clearly document swap details to illustrate netting.
- Provide comprehensive narrative for regulatory clarity.
- Validate reporting approach with finance stakeholders and regulatory reviewers (e.g., KPMG).

This summary captures essential responsibilities, regulatory expectations, and clear, actionable steps for both HR and finance functions.
