Below is an updated explanation of why **relying solely on the parent company’s plan for divestment** does **not** fulfill the CIDI’s regulatory requirement under Section 6. The key issue is that the regulatory text expressly assumes the **parent company and its affiliates are in resolution**, meaning the parent is not in a position to provide support or undertake a normal divestment process.

---

### 1. Focus on Parent’s Perspective, Not CIDI’s Assumed Scenario

- **Parent in Resolution:**  
  Section 6 explicitly requires analyzing the CIDI’s separation under the assumption that the parent company (and its affiliates) are already **in resolution** under 11 U.S.C. 101 et seq. or another insolvency regime.  
  - A **parent divestment plan** typically addresses the parent’s strategy to sell or spin off a subsidiary under normal or near‑normal conditions.  
  - It does **not** address how CIBC USA (the CIDI) would continue independently while the parent is itself insolvent and unable to provide either financial support or an orderly sell‑off process.

- **CIDI’s Viability and Franchise Value Post-Separation:**  
  The parent’s plan may not detail how **CIBC USA** will maintain operations, liquidity, and franchise value if the parent can no longer backstop it.  
  - **Regulatory Requirement:** Section 6 mandates a demonstration that the CIDI remains viable as a standalone entity when the parent is in resolution and presumably **unable** to assist.

### 2. Insufficient Detail on Operational Continuity and Separation Steps

- **Operational Continuity:**  
  The parent’s divestment plan often focuses on restructuring at the parent level. It may not specify:
  - The **operational steps** CIBC USA must take to sever shared systems and processes while the parent is in crisis.
  - How CIBC USA would handle **employee transitions, IT dependencies, or intercompany contracts** that could automatically terminate if the parent is in resolution.

- **Separation Actions:**  
  Section 6 calls for a clear, **cost‑effective, and timely** path to separate CIBC USA from the parent. A parent divestment plan typically assumes the parent has the luxury to manage the transaction. Under the Section 6 scenario, the parent is in distress, meaning:
  - The CIDI must have **its own** blueprint to remain operational if the parent’s resolution triggers immediate organizational upheaval.

### 3. Identification and Mitigation of Barriers Under Parent Insolvency

- **Focus on Obstacles When the Parent Fails:**  
  If the parent is in resolution, it can’t provide funding, facilitate an orderly migration of contracts, or ensure continuity of shared services.  
  - Section 6 requires the **CIDI** to explicitly identify potential barriers that arise specifically from that scenario (e.g., insolvent parent no longer paying shared service vendors, or cross‑defaults on contracts).  
  - A normal “divestment” plan won’t highlight or mitigate these insolvency-driven obstacles at the CIDI level.

- **Remedial Measures:**  
  Regulators expect detailed **remediation steps** to eliminate or minimize these obstacles.  
  - The parent’s plan may mention broad corporate strategies but rarely provides the granular, **CIDI-specific** contingency measures necessary if the parent collapses.

### 4. Bridge Bank Strategy and Receivership Components

- **Bridge Bank vs. Traditional Divestment:**  
  Section 6 specifically contemplates the possibility of a **bridge bank** to preserve the CIDI’s franchise value.  
  - In parent divestment scenarios, the usual assumption is a strategic sale. But if the parent is already **in resolution**, the plan must detail whether (and how) a bridge bank structure would be formed to maintain the CIDI’s critical functions.  
  - A parent plan rarely delves into the **step‑by‑step** approach for forming and running a bridge bank—particularly for the U.S. depository subsidiary—under FDIC resolution processes.

### Conclusion: What CIBC USA Actually Needs to Address

- **Standalone Resolution Focus:**  
  CIBC USA’s plan must show **how it will operate** if the parent cannot, ensuring the CIDI’s economic viability and franchise value as a bridge institution or otherwise.
  
- **Specific to Parent Insolvency Scenario:**  
  The submission must identify the unique obstacles triggered by the parent’s resolution, and detail immediate, actionable strategies to overcome them—far beyond the scope of a normal parent-led divestment.

- **Operational, Legal, and Financial Remediation:**  
  A thorough separation plan detailing how CIBC USA would manage legal contracts, shared technology, liquidity sources, and governance in a situation where the parent is no longer capable of assistance.

In short, the parent’s divestment approach is insufficient because **Section 6 presupposes the parent is in resolution** and demands a CIDI-centric plan ensuring CIBC USA’s continuity, viability, and orderly separation under those distressed conditions.
