The monitoring system flagged a brief sequence of cash-heavy days in which mid-sized cash deposits were followed—within one to two business days—by cheque withdrawals to third-party merchants. That “cash-in / cheque-out” pattern is a standard structuring-scenario trigger designed to surface potential cash placement and rapid layering through negotiable instruments.


Activity review and disposition of alerting items – cash and cheque cycle
A 134-day look-back shows three predictable sources of inflow: (i) daily cash deposits from over-the-counter sales at HH Liquor and Keg Liquor, (ii) card-settlement ACH credits from Merchant Bankcard / FDMS OKB / Beyond Bancard, and (iii) occasional internal transfers that top-up working capital. Outflows mirror that pattern: cheques drawn to inventory wholesalers (e.g., Harbor Distributing, Reyes Beer Division, Southern Wine & Spirits, California Lottery Commission), scheduled ACH debits to tax-and-fee agencies, and small internal transfers.

Structuring-alert review. The monitoring system flagged two consecutive cash deposits—\$4,700 on 03/18 and \$8,000 on 03/19—as potential structuring. Both were made at the customer’s regular branch, matched typical mid-week store takings, and were not followed by additional same-day deposits or withdrawals at other locations. No amount-splitting or branch-hopping was observed; the pair is assessed as routine retail cash flow, not structuring.

Cheque follow-through. Cheque-image review shows the cash deposits are routinely converted to supplier payments the next business day. Examples from the alerting cluster include:

* $1,214 cheque to Sam’s Club dated 02/13/25 for bulk consumables;
* $2,763 cheque to Ranch Wholesale dated 02/11/25 for grocery inventory;
* $1,417 cheque to Harbor Distributing LLC dated 02/12/25 for beer delivery (image and invoice on file).
  All alerting cheques are payable to recognised vendors; none are to “Cash,” the proprietor, or unknown parties, and no outbound wires were detected. Accordingly, the cash-in cheque-out velocity is considered typical of liquor-store inventory funding and does not evidence structuring or laundering.
