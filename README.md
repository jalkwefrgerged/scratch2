INVESTIGATION OUTCOME
Bank of America, N.A. (“BANA”) will file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) on BAOLIANG SHANG (Party ID 15011736604, DDA [LAST-4]) for:

• Structuring – cash deposits deliberately kept below the USD 10 000 Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold  
• Money-laundering / Unusual P2P transfers with an unknown source of funds  

Between 03 Mar 2025 and 22 Mar 2025 Mr Shang, who states he is “Unemployed,” deposited cash at several BANA locations and executed personal-to-personal (“P2P”) transfers that originated from an external account titled in his own name at [OTHER_BANK_NAME]. The activity lacks any lawful purpose and is consistent with BSA-evasion typologies.

------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
3) KYC & SOURCE-OF-FUNDS ANALYSIS
• Profile – Unemployed; Shanghai residential address (Gaorong Xiaoqu, 3-2307 Lane 661 Wanhangdu Rd); WA phone +1-425-615-5397  
• Open-source – No sanctions or adverse media. Subject registered and quickly dissolved [N_DISSOLVED_SHOPS] sole-owner e-commerce shops in Haikou, Hainan (VAT-rebate zone).  
• Income check (120-day look-back) – cash credits USD [CASH_TOTAL] + P2P credits USD [P2P_CREDIT_TOTAL] vs. verified ACH income USD [ACH_TOTAL] (negligible).  
• Cash withdrawals total USD [CASH_WD_TOTAL] (e.g., USD [WD_EX1] on [WD_DATE1]).  
➜ Deposits and transfers exceed any legitimate income; dissolved entities suggest shell use.

------------------------------------------------------------
4) ACCOUNT INFLOWS VS OUTFLOWS (HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW)
• Credits and debits track almost one-for-one, indicating pass-through use of the account.  
• Inflows are dominated by P2P credits and March cash deposits; payroll ACH is minimal.  
• Outflows consist mainly of ACH bill-pays, return transfers, and debit-card cash withdrawals.  

  Illustrative outflow transactions:  
  – 03/12/2025 ACH debit USD 1 045 “**[ELEC_CO_BILL]**”  
  – 03/22/2025 debit-card cash WD USD 600 “**[ATM 0047]/[ZIP]**”  
  – 03/25/2025 return item transfer debit USD 533 “**[RET_ITEM_002]**”

➜ The rapid money-in, money-out cycle without verifiable income supports the SAR’s Unusual P2P Activity, Structuring, and Unknown Source of Funds themes.

------------------------------------------------------------
