## Off‐Balance‐Sheet Exposures

### Overview of Key Off‐Balance‐Sheet Instruments

CIBC enters into a variety of off‐balance‐sheet financial instruments to meet client financing needs and to facilitate lending, foreign trade, and investment activities. The principal categories of these instruments include:

1. **Commitments to Extend Credit**  
2. **Letters of Credit**  
3. **Other Contractual Commitments** (e.g., CRA investments, recourse arrangements)  
4. **Mortgage Loans Sold with Recourse**  

Each of these exposures carries elements of credit and liquidity risk that **exceed** the amounts recorded on the Bank’s consolidated statement of financial condition, though many may never be drawn in full. All items are subject to CIBC’s standard credit approval, collateral, and risk monitoring processes.

*(Note for internal drafting: **Check** if the Bank has other OBS activities—e.g., merchant processing guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, rep/warranty triggers on asset sales, or **derivative** exposures. If inapplicable, consider explicitly stating they are immaterial or not utilized.)*

#### Materiality Thresholds and Ongoing Assessment

In line with FDIC guidance, CIBC determines which off‐balance‐sheet exposures are **material** for resolution planning based on **(Placeholder: Insert relevant thresholds—e.g., a percentage of Tier 1 Capital, total assets, or risk‐weighted assets.)** Any OBS category that exceeds these thresholds in a stress scenario will be subjected to additional resolution planning analysis (e.g., liquidity impact, potential need to transfer or run off the exposure).

*(Note for internal drafting: Clarify **how often** these thresholds are evaluated—e.g., quarterly, annually—and **where** stress scenarios or the supporting methodology are documented. Also consider specifying a timeframe for re‐evaluation if exposures change significantly.)*

### 1. Commitments to Extend Credit

CIBC’s unfunded **credit extension commitments** include **commercial**, **commercial real estate**, **construction**, and **residential mortgage** facilities. These agreements obligate the Bank to lend funds if the borrower meets certain conditions (e.g., financial covenants).  
- As of October 31, 2024, total commitments to extend credit amounted to \$14.74 billion (down from \$21.18 billion at October 31, 2023).  
- A significant portion of these commitments has terms of **less than one year**, and many may **expire without being drawn**, thus not necessarily representing future cash requirements.  
- The Bank maintains an **allowance for unfunded commitments** of \$73.9 million at October 31, 2024 (versus \$81.3 million at October 31, 2023), recorded under “other liabilities.”  

(Placeholder: **Insert a table** showing the breakdown of 2024 vs. 2023 commitments by type, along with their related allowances.)

*(Note for internal drafting: Consider **expanding** on the **nature and typical purposes** of each commitment type. Also clarify whether any of these commitments include special termination clauses or triggers that would become relevant in resolution.)*

### 2. Letters of Credit

CIBC issues **standby letters of credit** (financial and performance) and **commercial letters of credit** to support client payment obligations or facilitate domestic and international trade.  
- At October 31, 2024, total letters of credit reached \$1.36 billion, up slightly from \$1.31 billion at October 31, 2023.  
  - Of these, \$594 million represented standby letters of credit, \$100 million were performance standby letters, and \$669 million were commercial letters of credit.  
- When a client fails to perform or pay under the underlying agreement, the Bank’s credit loss exposure equals the **notional amount** of the letter of credit.  
- CIBC manages this credit risk similarly to its on‐balance‐sheet lending, requiring **collateral** where necessary and maintaining an allowance for letters of credit. The Bank also records **unrealized fees** (e.g., \$2.1 million at October 31, 2024) in other liabilities.

*(Note for internal drafting: If you track **average duration** or **weighted‐average term** of these LCs, or if you have different collateral practices for financial vs. performance LCs, consider adding that detail. Also confirm if there are any **industry concentrations** in these letters of credit.)*

### 3. Other Contractual Commitments

#### a. CRA Investments and Other Partnerships  
CIBC has committed \$246.9 million to Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and other investment partnerships.  
- \$198.8 million of these represent **legally‐binding, unfunded commitments** for tax‐credit investments, which are also reflected with nonmarketable equity in the consolidated statement of financial condition.

*(Note for internal drafting: **Confirm** if the Bank engages in any other **private investment** or **joint‐venture** arrangements that could create off‐balance‐sheet exposures. If so, consider listing them here or stating they are immaterial.)*

#### b. Third‐Party Commercial Credit Card Arrangements  
CIBC may guarantee certain commercial obligations under a recourse arrangement with a third‐party credit card provider.  
- The maximum potential **future payments** guaranteed by the Bank under this agreement stood at \$40.2 million at October 31, 2024.  
- Historically, losses under this program have been minimal, and no contingent liability is recorded at October 31, 2024, reflecting management’s view that additional losses are **unlikely**.

*(Note for internal drafting: If the Bank has any other **guarantees**—e.g., affiliate guarantees, performance guarantees for third‐party borrowings, etc.—consider adding them here. Also clarify whether these obligations have certain triggers that would be activated in a stress or resolution scenario.)*

---

### 4. Mortgage Loans Sold with Recourse

The Bank has also sold mortgage loans in the secondary market subject to **limited recourse** provisions.  
- Losses recorded for the years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 on these recourse provisions were **not material**.  
- Given insignificant historical losses, CIBC has **not established** a liability for potential future losses relating to such mortgage loans sold in prior periods.

*(Note for internal drafting: If the Bank has any **representations and warranties** that extend beyond normal recourse provisions, or if there are any repurchase triggers (e.g., for GSE loans), consider stating them here. Also note if there's a **rep/warranty reserve** or if these exposures are monitored under a separate policy.)*

---

### 5. Legal Proceedings

At October 31, 2024, CIBC was involved in several **legal proceedings** incidental to its regular business. Management does not consider any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, to have a **material adverse effect** on the Bank’s business or financial condition.

*(Note for internal drafting: Confirm if any **legal or regulatory** matters could result in off‐balance‐sheet obligations—e.g., litigation contingencies. If so, address whether they are recorded, unrecorded, or immaterial.)*

### Mapping to Core Business Lines, Franchise Components, and Material Asset Portfolios

(Placeholder: **Refer** to the section(s) in the resolution plan where the Bank’s Core Business Lines (CBLs), Franchise Components (FCs), and Material Asset Portfolios (MAPs) are defined. Summarize the key assignments below.)

- **Core Business Lines**:  
  - **Commercial Banking**: Likely includes commercial, commercial real estate, and construction commitments, as well as letters of credit servicing business clients.  
  - **Private, Personal, and Digital Banking**: Likely includes residential mortgage commitments, consumer‐oriented guarantees, etc.  

- **Franchise Components**:  
  - (Placeholder: **List** any designated franchise components—e.g., Commercial Real Estate, Treasury Liquid Asset Portfolio—and note which off‐balance‐sheet exposures, such as CRA investments or credit card recourse arrangements, might align with these components.)

- **Material Asset Portfolios**:  
  - (Placeholder: **Identify** which loan portfolios or other assets are deemed “material.” For example, “Unfunded commercial commitments map to the Commercial Loan Portfolio if drawn,” or “Residential mortgage commitments map to the Residential Mortgage Portfolio.”)

*(Note for internal drafting: **Consider** adding a more explicit statement on which OBS exposures map to which specific **CBL** or **Portfolio**—e.g., “X type of commitment is handled under the commercial banking line,” etc. If needed, integrate references to derivative exposures, merchant processing, etc.)*

---

### Resolution Considerations

While the regulation chiefly requires that off‐balance‐sheet exposures be **identified** and **mapped**, CIBC also acknowledges that these commitments or guarantees could migrate to on‐balance‐sheet obligations if drawn. The Bank’s risk mitigation includes credit approvals, collateral requirements, and allowances to manage potential defaults. **(Placeholder: Note** any relevant contractual triggers or termination clauses if a resolution event or insolvency occurs, and reference the specific resolution strategies—e.g., bridge bank transfer, partial run‐off—in another section of the plan.)

*(Note for internal drafting: Consider **highlighting** any unique termination features or cross‐default clauses that could impact how quickly OBS exposures come on‐balance‐sheet in a resolution scenario. Also, mention if the Bank intends to address these exposures through a **bridge bank strategy** or other resolution approach.)*

## Conclusion

CIBC has cataloged its key off‐balance‐sheet exposures—ranging from credit extension commitments and letters of credit to investment and recourse arrangements—and **aligned** them broadly with the Bank’s core business lines, franchise components, and potential material asset portfolios. Through ongoing monitoring, allowances, and collateral policies, the Bank maintains prudent oversight of these off‐balance‐sheet liabilities, thus enhancing resolution preparedness and overall financial stability. Once the placeholders are completed—particularly for **materiality thresholds**, any **derivative** exposures, and specialized off‐balance‐sheet instruments—this section will meet the FDIC’s (9) Off‐Balance‐Sheet Exposures requirement in full.
