Below is the same analysis **enhanced** with specialized details from your additional notes—such as market interest, feasibility of separation, viability, optionality, identification criteria, annual review processes, value drivers, and the importance of a data room. These refinements help ensure the CIDI’s response thoroughly addresses every aspect of **identifying separable and marketable franchise components** under requirement (i).

## Key Elements of the Requirement

1. **Identification of Franchise Components**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - The CIDI must list specific “franchise components” (i.e., significant businesses, product sets, or operational units) that can be sold, spun off, or otherwise separated from the institution during resolution.  
     - “Currently separable” implies these components can stand independently from the broader organization without requiring extensive restructuring or protracted negotiations. This includes assessing whether they can be disaggregated in a **timely manner** given their **operationally discrete** nature.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - In a resolution scenario, regulators, potential acquirers, and other stakeholders need clarity on which parts of the bank can quickly be carved out and sold or transferred in order to **maximize value** and **minimize disruption**.

   - **Additional Detail – Identification Criteria and Review Process:**  
     - **Annual Evaluation & Committee Approval:** Demonstrate how the bank identifies these components on an ongoing basis (e.g., annual or periodic reviews, committee oversight).  
     - **Quantitative & Qualitative Thresholds:** Show how significance is determined (e.g., a defined percentage of total assets, revenue, or liabilities, along with operational interconnectedness factors).

2. **Marketability in a Timely Manner**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Beyond listing the components, the CIDI must demonstrate that each identified component could generate **sufficient market interest** in a **short resolution timeframe**.  
     - This includes showcasing the component’s unique attributes, synergy opportunities, or reliable revenue sources that enhance its attractiveness to potential acquirers.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - **Speed is critical** in resolution for preserving franchise value and preventing broader financial fallout.  
     - Regulators want to see that these divestitures are **feasible** (operationally and financially) and **viable** (not threatening overall stability) under crisis conditions.

   - **Additional Detail – Market Interest & Optionality:**  
     - **Market Interest:** Indicate why acquirers would want the franchise component. For instance, highlight stable client bases, brand strength, or synergies with other businesses.  
     - **Optionality:** Stress how each component provides a “meaningful option” for the firm’s resolution—whether sold alone or bundled to create greater **value or synergy** in a transaction.

3. **Sufficiency for Group A CIDI Strategy (if applicable)**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - For a Group A CIDI, the identified components must be sufficient to support the bank’s broader resolution strategy—e.g., generating enough liquidity, simplifying operations, or preserving critical services.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - The resolution strategy likely depends on monetizing or isolating these components **without** causing instability.  
     - Regulators will test whether the plan’s dependence on these sellable units is realistic under stressed conditions.

4. **Value Drivers and Financial Viability**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Explain the **financial underpinnings** (revenue streams, cost structures, capital needs) that make each component attractive to buyers and feasible to separate.  
     - This includes clarifying how separation of the component won’t undermine the CIDI’s overall financial or operational viability.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - Buyers look at **revenue value drivers** (e.g., fee income, net interest income) and **cost drivers** (e.g., fixed vs. variable costs) to assess profitability and synergy potential.  
     - **Regulators** want to ensure each component can stand on its own or be sold **without** disrupting the bank’s essential functions.

5. **Evidence of Separability**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - A more detailed look at how each component can be **operationally and legally** detached from the main entity.  
     - Identify which **contracts, technology systems, or regulatory approvals** are needed for a clean transfer.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - Ensures that no insurmountable legal, technological, or operational barriers prevent a fast divestment.  
     - Demonstrates “feasibility of separation” so that the divestiture doesn’t stall during resolution.

   - **Additional Detail – Operational & Legal Analysis:**  
     - **Interconnections & FMU/Agent Bank Dependencies:** Show how components rely on external payment, clearing, and settlement services. If these are critical to the component’s operations, detail how that reliance will be preserved or replicated post-divestiture.  
     - **Mitigating Actions for Risks to Separability:** Note any pre-emptive steps (e.g., contracts with redundant service providers) to ensure the component remains viable on its own.

6. **Timing Considerations**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Indicate how quickly each franchise component could be put up for sale or transferred (days, weeks, months) in a distressed environment.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - In resolution, the **speed** of the transaction correlates directly with preserving franchise value.  
   - **Additional Detail – Data Room & Preparatory Steps:**  
     - Highlight the **process** for establishing a virtual data room, pre-collecting key financial/statutory reports, and any documentation that **facilitates bidder due diligence**.  
     - Emphasize existing capabilities or frameworks in place for rapid marketing of the asset.

7. **Alignment with the Resolution Strategy (especially for Group A CIDI)**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Confirm that the franchise components collectively fulfill or advance the resolution plan’s major objectives (e.g., raising liquidity, reducing complexity, ensuring continuity of critical functions).  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - Regulators will gauge whether each separable component can meaningfully address the bank’s systemic risk or capital shortfalls in resolution.  
   - **Additional Detail – Combining Components:**  
     - Explain whether selling certain components together might **maximize value** due to shared client bases or overlapping product lines.

8. **Potential Obstacles and Mitigations**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Identify barriers that could impede a timely sale—such as shared services, legal entanglements, FMU reliance, or cross-default clauses.  
     - Outline **mitigation steps** or “stand-alone” arrangements that circumvent these obstacles.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - A plan that fails to address known hurdles will appear unrealistic. Regulators expect a thorough articulation of **risks** and corresponding solutions.

## Conclusion

To fulfill this regulatory text, the CIDI’s response must:

- **Identify Franchise Components** using clear, formalized criteria (annual reviews, thresholds for significance) and demonstrate each component’s **operational discreteness** and **market interest**.  
- **Demonstrate Marketability & Viability** by showing potential acquirer demand and analyzing value drivers (revenue, cost structure, client relationships).  
- **Ensure Feasibility of Separation** via legal/operational assessments, addressing how FMU dependencies and other interconnections will be handled.  
- **Detail Timing & Preparedness**, including any data-room processes to expedite bidder due diligence.  
- **Show Alignment with Resolution Strategy**, especially for Group A CIDI, by confirming that collectively these components provide sufficient “optionality” and “value” for an orderly resolution.  
- **Address Obstacles and Mitigate Them**, ensuring no fatal blockers to a timely transaction.

By integrating these expanded details into the plan, the CIDI demonstrates a **robust approach** to identifying and readying franchise components that can be divested quickly and effectively, preserving value and minimizing risk during resolution.
