### 1. Introduction  
CIBC Bank USA (“the Bank”) submits this Full Resolution Plan in compliance with the FDIC’s requirements for Covered Insured Depository Institutions (CIDIs) subject to the Group B filter. We have structured our resolution strategy around a potential **bridge bank** to maintain critical operations and protect insured depositors if the FDIC were to initiate receivership. Our plan builds on a robust **contingency planning** framework that integrates liquidity risk management, operational readiness, and enterprise-wide governance. Since filing our last submission, we have conducted multiple exercises to validate and enhance these capabilities.

### 2. Bridge Bank Strategy Overview  
We designed our bridge bank approach to transfer core business lines, key systems, insured deposits, and other vital assets into an FDIC-managed bridge entity with minimal disruption to customers. Under this scenario:

1. **Transfer of Assets and Liabilities**:  
   We stand ready to transfer essential assets—such as loans, deposit accounts, and payment systems—to the bridge bank. This rapid segregation ensures that depositors retain immediate access to their funds.

2. **Continuity of Critical Operations**:  
   We maintain continuity in deposit-taking, lending, and payment clearing by migrating core systems and personnel to the bridge bank structure. These processes leverage our tested backup strategies to preserve franchise value.

3. **Preservation of Franchise Value**:  
   Once the bridge bank is established, the FDIC markets it to potential acquirers, seeking an optimal outcome that protects the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and maximizes value for creditors.

4. **Orderly Exit**:  
   We assume the bridge bank will operate temporarily, providing a stable platform for sale or wind-down. Our plan includes clear timelines for marketing the entity and ensures ongoing coordination with regulators.

### 3. Governance and Alignment with Contingency Funding  
Our **Resolution Planning Steering Committee (RPSC)** oversees all resolution preparations, including the bridge bank approach. The committee comprises senior leaders from Finance, Legal, Risk Management, Treasury, Operations, and Technology. We apply a **three-lines-of-defense** model:

- **Business Units** own day-to-day liquidity and funding decisions, supported by weekly liquidity stress testing (US LST) and ongoing risk assessments.  
- **Enterprise Risk Management** and committees such as the US Liquidity Management and Contingency Funding Committee (US LMCFC) and the US Asset & Liability Committee (US ALCO) provide oversight, challenge risk exposures, and coordinate remedial actions when conditions deteriorate or thresholds are breached.  
- **Internal Audit** conducts independent reviews of governance and controls, ensuring that our resolution processes meet regulatory expectations.

Crucially, our **Contingency Funding Plan (CFP)** defines how we secure funding under stress. We categorize potential funding sources by frequency of use and market impact. For example, we test more common funding sources—like Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances—through normal business transactions, while less frequently used options undergo operational reviews to ensure we can activate them swiftly in an emergency. Our **early warning indicators (EWIs)**, tied to Board Risk Tolerances (BRTs), prompt rapid escalations if signals of liquidity stress materialize.

### 4. Contingency Planning Exercises and Results  

#### 4.1 Multi-Day Tabletop Simulation (Q2 2024)  
We orchestrated a systemic financial stress scenario that triggered severe deposit outflows and forced the Bank into an FDIC receivership setting. Participants included senior leadership, treasury teams, operational units, external counsel, and FDIC observers. We tested:

- **Bridge Bank Activation**: We validated protocols for transferring core deposits, loans, and critical systems into a newly established bridge entity within 24–48 hours.  
- **CFP Deployment**: Treasury staff invoked backup funding measures—ranging from FHLB lines to secured borrowings—demonstrating that we could sustain liquidity through the bridging period.

**Outcome**:  
We identified a need to expand near-real-time data feeds on intraday liquidity positions, which we have since implemented. Otherwise, participants confirmed that bridging actions aligned with FDIC expectations for an orderly resolution.

#### 4.2 Operational Rehearsal (Q3 2024)  
We focused on technology dependencies and legal transfer mechanics. IT teams tested system separation for payments, treasury, and core banking platforms, and our Legal group simulated bridging contracts and counterpart notifications.

- **Technology Segregation**: We cloned and segregated mission-critical applications, ensuring minimal downtime for end users.  
- **Contractual Transfers**: We practiced transferring key vendor and service agreements to the bridge entity, including specialized clauses that allow the FDIC or the bridge bank to assume contracts instantly.

**Outcome**:  
This dry run demonstrated that we could replicate data stores within 12 hours and highlighted opportunities to expedite vendor communications. We have since strengthened vendor service-level agreements (SLAs) to accommodate a bridge bank scenario.

### 5. CFP Linkage to Resolution Readiness  
Our CFP sits at the heart of our liquidity risk management and seamlessly extends to resolution needs. We test it weekly via **US LST**, modeling deposit runoffs, unsecured funding maturities, and other stress factors. If critical thresholds are breached, the US LMCFC and US ALCO assess whether we must activate advanced CFP measures. We also integrate capital stress tests and broader enterprise risk assessments, ensuring the Bank remains resilient under severe macroeconomic conditions. These initiatives, while originally conceived for business continuity, create reliable data flows and escalation pathways that naturally support a bridge bank approach.

### 6. Implementation of Lessons Learned  
After these contingency exercises, we reinforced several key capabilities:

1. **Refined Bridge Bank Transition Manual**:  
   We added a step-by-step “playbook” that details responsible parties, tasks, and escalation triggers, ensuring clarity during a fast-moving resolution event.

2. **Strengthened Early Warning Indicators**:  
   We introduced new liquidity triggers tied to deposit outflow velocity, giving treasury staff earlier signals to escalate capital market transactions or pivot to last-resort funding.

3. **Updated Vendor and Counterparty Engagement**:  
   We incorporated expedited notification protocols and mandatory response timelines into existing vendor contracts, simplifying the migration of services to the bridge bank.

4. **Enhanced Data Monitoring**:  
   We upgraded our data warehouse to collect near-real-time liquidity metrics, capital adequacy measures, and EWI status. This upgrade shortens decision cycles and helps us meet FDIC timetables for bridging.

### 7. Best Practices and Alignment with FDIC Guidance  
We actively integrate **FDIC guidance** and industry best practices into our resolution planning. Our approach emphasizes:

- **Periodic Drills and Testing**: We conduct quarterly tabletop exercises or operational rehearsals that incorporate both liquidity and resolution scenarios.  
- **Robust Governance**: We escalate resolution triggers to the Board and relevant committees promptly, maintaining transparent accountability.  
- **Flexible Data Infrastructure**: We rely on integrated platforms that can seamlessly transition to a bridge bank environment, minimizing disruptions for customers and counterparties.  
- **Ongoing Improvement**: We continuously refine our internal policies, procedures, and contractual agreements based on post-exercise evaluations and changing market conditions.

### 8. Conclusion and Next Steps  
CIBC Bank USA remains confident in our ability to execute a **bridge bank** resolution strategy that protects depositors and preserves the franchise value of critical operations. Our ongoing drills, weekly stress tests, and structured governance underscore our readiness to respond swiftly and decisively to a severe stress event. Over the coming year, we plan to:

- Conduct an additional bridging tabletop exercise (target: Q4 2025) with deeper vendor engagement.  
- Update the Board on mid-cycle progress related to bridging readiness, focusing on vendor SLAs and data analytics enhancements.  
- Collaborate closely with the FDIC to ensure that our bridging protocols meet evolving regulatory standards.

We stand prepared to refine these strategies as needed to meet the FDIC’s expectations for orderly resolution and uphold our commitment to depositors, investors, and the broader financial system.
