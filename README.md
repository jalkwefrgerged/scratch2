## **Template: Material Affiliate Funding and Exposures**

### **1. Introduction**

This section of the Resolution Plan provides an overview of **CIBC Bank USA**’s (“the Bank” or “CIBC Bank USA”) **material affiliate funding relationships** and **inter-affiliate exposures** with its **parent company** (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) and other **parent company affiliates**. The disclosures focus on how these relationships could impact the Bank’s **liquidity, capital, or overall financial stability** in a resolution scenario.

### **2. Defining “Material” Affiliate Relationships and Exposures**

To ensure consistency and clarity, **CIBC Bank USA** applies the following **materiality criteria** to determine which affiliate funding relationships and exposures must be disclosed:

1. **Quantitative Thresholds**  
   - **Size Relative to Capital or Assets**: Any exposure or funding arrangement that exceeds **[X%]** of the Bank’s **Tier 1 Capital** or **total assets** is deemed material.  
   - **Potential Liquidity Impact**: Exposures or funding lines whose withdrawal or default could reduce the Bank’s **available liquidity** by **[Y%]** or more.

2. **Qualitative Factors**  
   - **Critical Function Support**: Even if an arrangement falls below quantitative thresholds, it is considered material if it supports a **critical function** (e.g., large deposit concentration, daily settlement, clearing activities).  
   - **Contractual or Legal Triggers**: Funding or exposures with **cross-default clauses** or **guarantees** that could be triggered under stress conditions.  
   - **Strategic Significance**: Relationships tied to **key business lines** or **product offerings** that are essential to the Bank’s operations or reputation.

**Rationale**  
- This blended approach **captures large exposures** while also identifying **smaller but critical** relationships that could create **contagion or operational risks**.

**Application**  
- **Annual Review**: The Bank re-evaluates these thresholds at least annually, adjusting for **business model changes** or **new regulatory guidance**.  
- **Documentation**: All relationships meeting any **quantitative** or **qualitative** criterion are classified as “material” and are detailed below.
