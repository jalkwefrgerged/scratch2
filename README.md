**Contingency Planning Exercises and Bridge Bank Strategy Viability**  
**CIBC Bank USA**  
**Date: March 17, 2025**

Since the date of our most recently filed full resolution submission, CIBC Bank USA has conducted several contingency planning exercises specifically designed to evaluate and refine our readiness under the Bank’s identified resolution strategy, which includes the potential use of a bridge bank. The purpose of these exercises was to assess how effectively the Bank could preserve critical operations and maintain customer access to key services if it were required to transition into a bridge bank structure under FDIC receivership. In alignment with the FDIC’s mandate, the following paragraphs describe the nature, extent, and results of these planning efforts, highlighting any enhancements to capabilities that emerged from the testing.

**Nature and Extent of the Exercises:**  
CIBC Bank USA integrates ongoing contingency planning into its broader operational and risk-management framework. In this cycle, the Bank organized two main exercises to evaluate the viability of using a bridge bank structure to ensure continuity of critical functions. First, a multi-day **tabletop simulation** brought together senior leadership, treasury personnel, operational teams, and technology resources. Participants worked through a hypothetical scenario in which systemic financial stress caused major liquidity challenges and triggered significant deposit outflows. Under this scenario, the FDIC initiated resolution proceedings, prompting the activation of the Bank’s bridge bank strategy to preserve essential operations, including deposit-taking, lending, and payments processing.  
   
The second exercise was a **cross-functional operational rehearsal** focusing on technology dependencies and legal transfer mechanics. This exercise tested the Bank’s ability to rapidly isolate and maintain access to key systems, such as payments processing platforms and loan accounting databases, under a scenario where assets and liabilities were transferred into a bridge bank. Participants verified data integrity, simulated the execution of transfer documents, and walked through communication protocols with vendors, counterparties, and customers. Both exercises included an escalation path that involved the Bank’s crisis management teams, as well as interactions with external stakeholders who would play a role in a real resolution scenario (e.g., the FDIC, core systems providers, and correspondent banks).

**Results and Viability of the Bridge Bank Strategy:**  
The exercises confirmed that CIBC Bank USA can, with an appropriate lead time, effectively transition essential financial and operational services into a bridge bank while minimizing disruption to depositor access and critical banking functions. Key findings included:

1. **Liquidity Preservation and Funding Access:**  
   Treasury and finance personnel demonstrated the ability to invoke the Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) to secure backup liquidity. This included fast-tracking short-term borrowings, drawing on Federal Home Loan Bank lines, and readying certain marketable securities for potential liquidation. Collectively, these measures were deemed sufficient to stabilize funding throughout the bridge bank setup period.

2. **Systems and Operational Readiness:**  
   Technology teams successfully showcased the ability to clone and segregate core systems (loan, deposit, and payment platforms) for use within the bridge bank. Testing revealed no material gaps in system access or data integrity. Participants also validated processes for reconfiguring data links, user access, and payment flows so that these essential services could remain operational, even under resolution-driven time constraints.

3. **Legal Transfer and Coordination Protocols:**  
   Legal counsel and operational managers walked through the steps required to transfer critical assets and liabilities to a newly chartered bridge bank. This included drafting and executing bridging agreements, notifying counterparties, and coordinating with FDIC liaisons. The exercise confirmed that CIBC Bank USA’s existing contract management systems and data repositories provide the necessary legal and operational detail to facilitate rapid asset transfer while preserving continuity of customer relationships.

4. **Governance and Decision-Making:**  
   The Bank’s crisis governance framework effectively escalated decision-making from front-line teams to senior management, demonstrating that committees such as the US Asset & Liability Committee (US ALCO) and US Liquidity Management and Contingency Funding Committee (US LMCFC) could pivot their mandates swiftly under the resolution scenario. Clear lines of authority were maintained during the simulated transition, allowing for efficient coordination between business lines, enterprise risk management, and external regulators.

**Improvements to Resolution Capabilities:**  
Based on the lessons learned during these exercises, CIBC Bank USA implemented several enhancements to ensure even more robust resolution preparedness:

- **Refined Bridge Bank Activation Playbook:** The Bank updated its Bridge Bank Transition Manual to include a step-by-step checklist of tasks, responsible parties, and estimated completion times, incorporating feedback from participants and streamlining communication pathways.  
- **Enhanced Early Warning Indicators:** Additional liquidity triggers were introduced to prompt earlier mobilization of the Bank’s CFP measures, thereby mitigating the risk of short-notice disruptions.  
- **Vendor and Counterparty Engagement Protocols:** The Bank formalized contingency communication plans for critical service providers, ensuring that essential vendors receive timely instructions on system reconfigurations, data migration, and operational handovers if a bridge bank strategy is invoked.  
- **Expanded Testing of Collateral and Funding Mechanisms:** In anticipation of rapid liquidity demands, the Bank broadened its testing procedures for pledging collateral, synchronizing internal records with counterparties’ systems to reduce friction in emergency borrowing situations.

**Conclusion:**  
Through these contingency-planning exercises, CIBC Bank USA evaluated and strengthened the viability of using a bridge bank strategy as part of its broader resolution preparedness. The results confirmed that core operations—particularly deposit-taking, lending, and payment services—could be maintained with minimal disruption if the FDIC were to initiate resolution proceedings. These findings underscore the Bank’s commitment to preserving customer confidence, mitigating systemic risk, and maintaining operational continuity in extreme stress events. Moreover, the Bank’s ongoing enhancements to its governance framework, liquidity triggers, and system readiness further improve its resolution capabilities, ensuring that the FDIC’s requirements for timely and orderly resolution continue to be met.
