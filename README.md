Below is a **combined gap analysis** and **concise outline** of what must be provided under subsection (vii). The gap analysis highlights **shortcomings** in the stakeholder’s existing response, and the outline details **exactly** what the CIDI should disclose—only incorporating items **relevant** to the regulatory text.

## **GAP ANALYSIS**

**Stakeholder Response (vii):**  
> *“CIBC’s US registered broker‐dealer is CIBC World Markets Corp. Please refer to slide 8 of the ‘US‐Entity Organizational Structure and Naming Convention Standards.’ Controllership can provide descriptions on the interconnectedness between legal entities. Please reach out to Emily Lundberg.”*

1. **Insufficient Service Description:**  
   - The response does not specify **which services** (e.g., trade execution, advisory) the broker‐dealer provides to the CIDI or its customers.

2. **No Integration Detail:**  
   - It references an organizational chart but **doesn’t explain** how the broker‐dealer is integrated operationally (shared systems, branding, or cross‐selling with the CIDI).

3. **No Analysis of Discontinuation Risks:**  
   - The response lacks any **discussion** of what happens if broker‐dealer services are abruptly halted (impact on operations, customers, compliance, etc.).

4. **Missing Mitigation Measures:**  
   - There is no mention of **actions** the CIDI would take to reduce disruption—such as alternative providers, transition services, or contractual safeguards.

5. **Over‐Reliance on External Reference:**  
   - Pointing to slides or an individual contact does not meet the requirement for a **self‐contained** explanation or plan.

## **OUTLINE: WHAT MUST BE PROVIDED TO SATISFY REQUIREMENT (vii)**

### 1. **Description of the Broker‐Dealer Relationship**

- **Identify the Entity**  
  - Name “CIBC World Markets Corp.” as the relevant broker‐dealer (subsidiary or affiliate status, if not already clear).  
  - Indicate if it’s registered under FINRA, SEC, or other regulatory bodies.

- **Services to the CIDI or CIDI Customers**  
  - Specify what products/functions the BD handles, e.g., trade execution, custody, advisory, underwriting.  
  - Clarify whether the BD supports the CIDI’s own operational needs (like treasury/capital markets) or provides offerings to the CIDI’s retail/commercial clients.

- **Integration with the CIDI’s Business & Operations**  
  - Note any **shared resources** (IT systems, staff, brand elements) or **cross‐selling** practices.  
  - State if these BD activities are **crucial** to any of the CIDI’s core business lines.

---

### 2. **Analysis of Potential Challenges from Discontinuation**

- **Operational Gaps**  
  - Explain how a sudden cutoff of BD services would affect the CIDI’s day‐to‐day (e.g., halted trading, lost product lines).  
  - Note **compliance exposures** (e.g., licensing, recordkeeping) if the BD is abruptly gone.

- **Customer & Reputational Risks**  
  - Address potential **client disruption** (loss of brokerage or advisory services).  
  - Consider reputational harm if customers can’t access expected investment capabilities.

- **Legal & Contractual Considerations**  
  - Reference **any intercompany agreements** or contractual dependencies (clearing, data sharing).  
  - Clarify if client data or transaction records are under the BD’s control and how that might be affected by discontinuation.

---

### 3. **Actions to Mitigate Such Challenges**

- **Contingency Plans & Alternative Providers**  
  - Identify backup broker‐dealers or third‐party arrangements that could step in.  
  - Consider whether the CIDI can **temporarily insource** key BD functions.

- **Transition Services & Contractual Safeguards**  
  - Document any **transition service agreements** that reduce the impact if the BD separates.  
  - Note clauses enabling **smooth migration** of client accounts or data in a disruption.

- **Operational & Technological Separation**  
  - Describe any **standalone systems** or resources that help the CIDI function if the BD fails.  
  - Include mention of staff training, alternate workflows, or **disaster recovery** relevant to the broker‐dealer link.

---

### 4. **Summary of Required Documentation**

1. **Clear Description of the BD’s Role & Interdependencies**  
   - Self‐contained explanation (not just a reference to slides or external individuals).  
2. **Comprehensive Risk Analysis** for Discontinuation  
   - Operational, customer, and legal exposures if services suddenly end.  
3. **Detailed Mitigation Measures**  
   - Plans and backup strategies so CIDI can withstand the BD’s unavailability.

**By providing the above details—filling in the current gaps on service descriptions, integration, potential discontinuation risks, and mitigation strategies—the CIDI’s submission will fully meet the requirement in subsection (vii).**
