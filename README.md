Below is a revised version of the consolidated document. It first explains why **relying solely on the parent company’s plan to sell off CIBC USA** fails to meet the regulatory requirement under Section 6, given the assumption that the parent is itself in resolution. It then transitions into an outline of what the CIDI’s resolution submission should address.

## 1. Why the Stakeholder’s Reliance on the Parent’s Plan to Sell CIBC USA Is Insufficient

Under Section 6, the regulator assumes the **parent company and its affiliates are in resolution** under 11 U.S.C. 101 et seq. (or another insolvency regime). This means the parent cannot be counted on for an orderly transaction or divestment. A parent-focused plan on how it might “sell” the subsidiary in normal or near-normal conditions falls short because:

1. **Scenario Misalignment:**  
   - **Normal Divestment vs. Parent Insolvency:**  
     The parent’s plan describes selling off CIBC USA as though the parent has the time, resources, and stability to orchestrate a strategic sale.  
     - Under Section 6, the parent is itself in crisis and cannot oversee or fund a normal divestment process, leaving the CIDI to demonstrate how it would stand alone.

2. **Lack of CIDI-Centric Continuity Measures:**  
   - The parent’s plan often omits how CIBC USA would maintain day-to-day operations if the parent is insolvent.  
   - Section 6 demands the CIDI’s own blueprint for remaining economically viable—particularly for capital, liquidity, shared services, and IT support—without depending on the parent’s ability to manage a sale.

3. **Failure to Address Distressed Separation Actions:**  
   - **Parent Unable to Support:**  
     If the parent is in resolution, transitional service agreements or orderly migration strategies typically assumed in a sale scenario may be unavailable.  
   - **Regulatory Requirement:**  
     Section 6 calls for a timely, cost‑effective separation plan specifically designed for the parent’s insolvency, not a standard divestment.

4. **Insufficient Identification of Insolvency-Driven Barriers:**  
   - A normal sale plan rarely analyzes the immediate barriers triggered by parent insolvency (e.g., cross-default clauses, terminated shared-service arrangements).  
   - The CIDI must list and mitigate these obstacles—particularly around legal contracts, technology dependencies, and vendor relationships—when the parent can no longer provide support.

5. **Overlooking the Bridge Bank Option:**  
   - A parent-led sale strategy presumes a voluntary transaction with a buyer.  
   - Section 6 envisions a **bridge bank** solution if necessary, allowing CIBC USA’s critical operations and franchise value to continue under FDIC receivership. The parent’s plan generally does not delve into this U.S.-specific resolution mechanism.

**In short,** because the parent’s plan is geared toward a normal sale scenario, it does **not** satisfy the Section 6 requirement that the CIDI demonstrate a stand‑alone strategy for preserving economic viability, addressing interdependencies, and mitigating obstacles if the parent is already in resolution.

## 2. Outline of What the CIDI’s Resolution Submission Must Address

Below is a high-level outline aligned with Section 6 requirements. It explains how CIBC USA (the CIDI) should structure its own submission to demonstrate an orderly resolution process, under the assumption that the parent is insolvent.

### I. Introduction
- **Objective:**  
  - Show that CIBC USA can operate independently from the parent, even when the parent is in resolution.  
  - Confirm the assumption that the parent (and affiliates) are undergoing their own insolvency proceedings.

### II. Bridge Bank Strategy and Separation Analysis
- **Bridge Bank Strategy:**  
  - Lay out how a bridge bank would preserve the CIDI’s franchise value if the parent collapses.  
  - Specify which critical functions (e.g., deposit-taking, payment systems) would transition into the bridge structure.  
- **Prerequisite Actions:**  
  - Identify the legal, operational, and financial steps the CIDI must take beforehand to enable a swift, cost‑effective move into a bridge bank if needed.

### III. Detailed Considerations for Separation

1. **Legal Considerations:**
   - **Actions & Issues:**  
     - Detail which contracts or intercompany arrangements must be renegotiated or terminated.  
     - Note regulatory approvals and any litigation or cross-default risks.  
   - **Remediation:**  
     - Plan for how these issues will be resolved if the parent cannot cooperate.

2. **Operational Considerations:**
   - **People, Processes, Technology:**  
     - Explain how CIBC USA will ensure continuity of staff, IT systems, and back-office functions without the parent’s funding or oversight.  
     - Describe governance changes required to reflect CIBC USA’s standalone status.
   - **Implementation Plan:**  
     - Present a timeline with key tasks and milestones for achieving operational autonomy.

3. **Financial Considerations:**
   - **Balance Sheet Analysis:**  
     - Assess capital adequacy, liquidity, and other financial factors essential for an independent CIDI.  
     - Include contingency planning for withdrawing parent funding or guarantees.
   - **Financial Actions:**  
     - Outline any restructuring or reallocation of assets and liabilities to stabilize operations under separation.

4. **Communications Strategy:**
   - **Internal & External Communications:**  
     - Indicate how the CIDI will organize internal teams and decision-making forums in a crisis.  
     - Describe external communications to regulators, customers, counterparties, and employees regarding the parent’s resolution and CIBC USA’s separation.

### IV. Bridge Bank vs. Receivership Components
- **Criteria for Transfer:**  
  - Show how you’ll decide which assets, liabilities, and contracts go into the bridge bank and which remain in receivership.  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Explain why non-core or problematic items may remain in receivership, ensuring the CIDI’s core franchise remains viable.

### V. Summary and Remediation Steps
- **Integrated Plan Recap:**  
  - Summarize how legal, operational, and financial strategies align to allow prompt separation from the parent.  
- **Barriers & Mitigation:**  
  - Enumerate any hurdles, from shared IT systems to contractual obligations, and explain how these are resolved or minimized under parent insolvency conditions.

### Conclusion

By following this outline, the CIDI will develop a **self-contained resolution strategy** that accounts for the parent’s being in resolution and the resulting unavailability of normal divestment pathways. Such a plan ensures:

- **Standalone Resilience:** CIBC USA’s franchise value remains intact, with access to capital, operations, and governance structures independent of the parent.  
- **Bridge Bank Clarity:** Clear criteria for forming a bridge bank and transferring crucial business elements under FDIC receivership.  
- **Timely & Cost-Effective Separation:** A defined roadmap for mitigating obstacles, renegotiating contracts, and ensuring business continuity—even without the parent’s support.  

This contrasts with a typical **parent-centric divestment plan**, which presupposes a functioning parent capable of managing a sale—an assumption Section 6 explicitly sets aside.
