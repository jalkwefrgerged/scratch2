### Ownership and HR Role Clarification:
- HR is responsible for identifying **people risk**, but **not responsible for mitigation strategies**.
  - Mitigation strategies for personnel risks (e.g., retention, incentives) are primarily the responsibility of business lines and finance.
- HR provides frameworks, identifies people risks, but does not decide resource allocations or detailed mitigation strategies (e.g., retention awards, financial incentives).
- HR creates key personnel lists in collaboration with business units, but decisions about resource allocation and hiring remain business and finance decisions.

### Mitigation Strategy and HR’s Involvement:
- Mitigation strategies, including retention awards, hiring, compensation decisions, are a joint responsibility between business lines and finance.
- HR supports this by providing frameworks and generating necessary reports (e.g., Workday lists).
- HR does not execute or own the final mitigation decisions—only facilitates identification of key personnel and provides input regarding people-related risks.

### Key Personnel Identification:
- Key personnel should be identified by:
  - Job titles/functions
  - Compensation grade levels (such as "Level 7 and above" or equivalent)
  - Employee's legal employing entity
  - Location
  - Core business line affiliation
- Identification should consider:
  - Employees critical for capital and liquidity management
  - Employees needed for executing critical decisions during resolution
  - Those with expertise or relationships vital to maintaining franchise value or aiding in divestitures
- HR provides a general framework, but specific mitigation details (like who gets retained and how) should be determined by business lines.

### FDIC Expectations:
- The FDIC expects detailed mapping of key roles, especially for franchise components important for separability.
- FDIC wants to know the rationale behind identifying key personnel and the capability to regularly refresh these lists.
- Employee retention contracts or agreements are not explicitly required by FDIC but should be clearly articulated in terms of methodology and logic.

### Resolution and Business Continuity (BCM):
- The resolution scenario differs from typical BCM events (long-term vs. short-term disruptions).
- HR’s role in BCM is limited; BCM team (Nandita specifically) will primarily manage continuity-of-services issues.
- HR should collaborate closely with the BCM team to ensure correct identification and management of key personnel for long-term disruptions.

### Data and Reporting Systems:
- Current HR systems (e.g., Workday) do not fully support detailed identification by job family/function due to misalignment between HR job families and actual roles, particularly in the U.S.
- The recommended approach is to provide general descriptions (broad-brush approach) rather than overly prescriptive details, maintaining flexibility in identifying key roles.

### Next Steps:
- Update existing tables to include FDIC-required columns: employee titles/functions, location, core business lines, and legal employing entities.
- Confirm sources and accuracy of any diagrams or process maps (e.g., BCM-related process map).
- Address redundancy or irrelevance by deleting outdated information copied from the parent resolution plan.
- Clarify roles of committees or governance structures mentioned, particularly regarding HR's role or involvement.
- Ensure ongoing updates can be automated or easily refreshed in the future (e.g., flagging in Workday rather than using employee names).

## Off-Balance Sheet Exposure Reporting:
- **Consolidation at Bank Level:**
  - Provide aggregated off-balance sheet exposures at Bank USA level.
  - Use "X" to indicate alignment with core business lines rather than detailing values by franchise component.

- **Types of Exposures:**
  - Client-facing swaps (interest rate, FX).
  - Corresponding offsetting or hedging swaps clearly documented for netting clarity.

- **Netting and Documentation:**
  - Explicitly present both client-side and hedging swaps for transparency.
  - Provide narrative explanation of consolidated reporting rationale and netting methodology.

## Regulatory Compliance and Clarity:
- Clearly articulate exposure reporting methodology to satisfy FDIC requirements.
- Provide comparison context where applicable to industry peers.

## Immediate Finance Action Items:
- Update off-balance sheet exposure table to reflect consolidation approach.
- Clearly document swap details to illustrate netting.
- Provide comprehensive narrative for regulatory clarity.
- Validate reporting approach with finance stakeholders and regulatory reviewers (e.g., KPMG).

This summary captures essential responsibilities, regulatory expectations, and clear, actionable steps for both HR and finance functions.
