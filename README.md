Below is a consolidated document that first explains **why the stakeholder’s reliance on the parent company’s divestment plan is insufficient** to meet Section 6 requirements, then **transitions into a high-level outline** of what the CIDI’s own resolution submission should address.

---

## 1. Why the Stakeholder’s Reliance on the Parent’s Divestment Plan Is Insufficient

Section 6 explicitly assumes that the **parent company and its affiliates are in resolution** under 11 U.S.C. 101 et seq. (or another insolvency regime). Under these distressed conditions, the parent is **not** in a position to provide orderly divestment or continued support. A parent-centric plan typically:

1. **Focuses on Normal or Near-Normal Divestment:**
   - Parent-level strategies assume the ability to manage the spin‑off or sale of the subsidiary in a controlled manner.
   - This does **not** reflect the scenario in which the parent is insolvent and unable to protect or financially back the subsidiary (CIBC USA).

2. **Lacks CIDI-Centric Continuity Measures:**
   - The parent’s plan rarely details how CIBC USA would handle day-to-day operations, capital/liquidity management, or technology if the parent is no longer paying for or administering shared services.
   - Section 6 demands a blueprint for **CIBC USA to stand alone** and remain economically viable, even if the parent is fully incapacitated.

3. **Does Not Address Separation Under Distress:**
   - If the parent is in resolution, typical “divestment” steps (e.g., sale negotiations, transitional service agreements) may be unavailable or severely curtailed.
   - Section 6 requires **timely and cost‑effective** separation actions designed with the parent already in crisis.

4. **Fails to Identify and Mitigate Insolvency-Driven Barriers:**
   - Under normal divestment plans, many potential barriers (like cross-default clauses or operational dependencies on the parent) are not considered acute obstacles.
   - Section 6 requires the CIDI to list such obstacles **and** describe how they would be remediated if the parent can no longer fulfill its obligations.

5. **Ignores the Bridge Bank Scenario:**
   - A standard parent-led divestment strategy assumes a voluntary transaction.  
   - Section 6 anticipates the potential need for a **bridge bank**, which is a mechanism used under FDIC receivership to preserve franchise value and critical operations. The parent’s plan generally does not delve into these **U.S. resolution specifics**.

In summary, because the parent’s plan does not account for **the parent itself being in resolution**, it does **not** satisfy the regulatory requirement for demonstrating how the **CIDI** can independently maintain economic viability, address interdependencies, and mitigate obstacles in a distressed separation scenario.

## 2. Outline of What the CIDI’s Resolution Submission Must Address

Below is a high-level outline that integrates Section 6 requirements. It explains how the CIDI should prepare its own submission to demonstrate an orderly resolution process, assuming the parent is in resolution and unable to provide support.

### I. Introduction
- **Objective:**  
  - Explain that the submission proves the CIDI’s ability to operate separately from the parent, even under distressed conditions.
  - Acknowledge the assumption that the parent (and affiliates) are in resolution under an insolvency regime.

### II. Bridge Bank Strategy and Separation Analysis
- **Bridge Bank Strategy:**  
  - Outline how a bridge bank could preserve franchise value if the parent is insolvent.  
  - Specify which critical functions would transfer into the bridge bank.  
- **Prerequisite Actions:**  
  - Identify the steps the CIDI must take beforehand (e.g., legal preparations, operational cutovers) to ensure the bridge bank is established promptly and smoothly.

### III. Detailed Considerations for Separation

1. **Legal Considerations:**
   - **Actions & Issues:**  
     - Summarize required legal steps to sever ties with the parent, such as reviewing or renegotiating intercompany agreements.  
     - Note any regulatory approvals or litigation risks that might arise.
   - **Remediation:**  
     - Detail strategies for handling these issues if the parent is unable to cooperate (e.g., default clauses, forced contract terminations).

2. **Operational Considerations:**
   - **People, Processes, and Technology:**  
     - Identify how the CIDI will secure necessary IT systems, human resources, and back‑office functions without parent support.  
     - Clarify governance adjustments required when the parent’s management can’t intervene.
   - **Implementation Plan:**  
     - Provide a timeline for operational independence, indicating key milestones and resource needs.

3. **Financial Considerations:**
   - **Balance Sheet Analysis:**  
     - Assess capital, liquidity, and other financial needs to ensure standalone resilience.  
     - Anticipate withdrawal or non-availability of parent funding.  
   - **Financial Actions:**  
     - Explain how the CIDI will restructure or reallocate resources (e.g., transferring assets, liabilities) to stabilize its finances during separation.

4. **Communications Strategy:**
   - **Internal and External Communications:**  
     - State how you’ll coordinate internal teams (risk, ops, legal) to handle the crisis scenario.
     - Outline external communications to regulators, customers, counterparties, and employees.

### IV. Defining the Components of Bridge Bank Versus Receivership
- **Features of the Bridge Bank:**  
  - List which assets, liabilities, and contracts are deemed critical and thus moved to the bridge bank.  
  - Explain the criteria used to differentiate items that remain in receivership.
- **Receivership Considerations:**  
  - Clarify what is left behind and why (e.g., non-core assets, certain obligations).

### V. Summary and Remediation Steps
- **Overall Strategy Recap:**  
  - Tie together the legal, operational, and financial angles to show an integrated plan for independence.
- **Identified Barriers and Mitigation:**  
  - Specifically list any obstacles (e.g., shared tech systems) and how the CIDI will mitigate them (e.g., stand-alone infrastructure, third-party vendor contracts).

**By adopting this CIDI-specific outline**, the resolution submission will:

- **Address the Assumption of Parent Resolution:** Demonstrate how the CIDI remains viable when the parent is insolvent.  
- **Detail Required Separation Steps:** Clearly articulate the cost-effective, timely measures for forming a bridge bank or alternative structure.  
- **Identify and Mitigate Obstacles:** Enumerate potential barriers and how they will be resolved under distressed conditions.  
- **Preserve Franchise Value:** Ensure that the CIDI’s critical functions continue, protecting customers and maintaining economic viability.

This contrasts with a normal corporate divestment plan (which presupposes a functioning parent) by **fully reflecting Section 6’s requirement** for a self-contained strategy that anticipates the parent’s inability to assist or to manage an orderly spin‑off.
