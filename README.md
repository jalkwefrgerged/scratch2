I help risk and compliance teams turn complex regulatory expectations into clear, defensible outcomes that stand up to review. I do this by translating ambiguous requirements into an execution plan, aligning stakeholders on decisions and owners, and driving the analysis and written deliverables to an audit-traceable standard. Where it adds leverage, I build AI- and code-enabled workflows to accelerate document synthesis and drafting while keeping controls, versioning, and human review built in—so teams move faster without sacrificing quality or governance.
