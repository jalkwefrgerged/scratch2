Below is a **gap analysis** that compares the **regulatory requirement** for non‐deposit claims to the **stakeholder responses** provided. The requirement states that the CIDI must describe its **systems and processes** used to identify unsecured creditors (non-deposit), the **location of records**, **recordkeeping practices**, any **inter‐creditor agreements**, and the capability to **produce a list** (name, address, liability type, amount owed) for each unsecured creditor—including those at each **material entity** subsidiary.

---

## **Regulatory Requirement (High‐Level Recap)**

The CIDI’s full resolution submission must:
1. **Identify & Describe** the systems and processes that track **unsecured, non‐deposit creditors** of the CIDI (and each material subsidiary).
2. **Identify Recordkeeping Practices**: Show where and how these records are maintained, including inter‐creditor agreements.
3. **Demonstrate Capability**: The bank must be able to pull each unsecured creditor’s name, address, nature of liability, and amount owed—or, for indentured securities, the indenture trustee.

## **Stakeholder Responses**

### 1. **Justin’s Response**
- Summarizes **balance sheet data** showing total liabilities (\$51.4 billion), of which \$49.4 billion are deposits.
- Concludes **\$2 billion** in non‐deposit claims, primarily:
  - **\$1.15 billion** note payable to a parent affiliate (CIBC Investments USA Inc.).
  - **\$850 million** from CRA future capital contributions, derivative liabilities, etc.
- References “Finance monthly LE reports” for tracking, but does **not** describe how the bank locates all unsecured creditors beyond these broad categories.

### 2. **Dan’s Response (Credit Risk Management)** 
- Introduces the **Net Exposure Report** for tracking correspondent exposures and concentration ratios.
- Mentions the **Correspondent Credit Risk Management Policy**, used to capture and monitor aggregate exposures.
- Explains how Letters of Credit and **Capital Markets** exposures (derivatives) feed into the Net Exposure Report.
- References **ACBS** for internal credit approvals/LCs, **Collateral Snapshot** for derivative mark‐to‐market, and **ISDA/CSA** for margin/collateral.
- Mentions “PrivateLink” repository for outstanding agreements but does not fully detail how they handle **record location** or how to produce a list of every unsecured creditor (complete with name, address, liability type, etc.).
- Focuses on **correspondent institutions** (counterparties) but does not explicitly address other non‐deposit liabilities (e.g., trade payables, inter‐creditor agreements, or potential for other subsidiaries to have unsecured creditors).

---

## **Gap Analysis**

1. **Location & Recordkeeping of Unsecured Claims**  
   - The responses do not **clearly state** where records are kept, whether physically or digitally, nor how they can be **accessed** in a resolution scenario.  
   - Although “ACBS,” “Collateral Snapshot,” and “Net Exposure Report” are mentioned, we lack a **unified explanation** of how all non‐deposit liabilities are cataloged beyond capital markets/correspondent lines.

2. **Comprehensive System/Process Description**  
   - Dan’s explanation outlines Net Exposure Reports for counterparties, but:  
     - **Other** potential unsecured creditors (accounts payable, trade creditors, settlement obligations, or those at material subsidiaries) aren’t fully addressed.  
     - There is no mention of **processes** for scanning the general ledger or other systems to ensure that **all** unsecured liabilities are captured in real time.

3. **Inter‐Creditor Agreements**  
   - The text requires identifying if there are **agreements** ranking or structuring claims among unsecured creditors.  
   - Neither response explicitly states whether any subordination or inter‐creditor agreements exist beyond standard ISDA/CSA for derivatives. This is a gap.

4. **Capability to Identify Each Creditor (Name, Address, Amount, Nature)**  
   - Dan references some forms of identification for counterparties in **Capital Markets** and **LC** lines.  
   - However, it’s unclear if the bank can produce a **granular list** with each creditor’s name, address, type of liability, and amount across **all** non‐deposit liabilities (including trade payables, lease liabilities, or other payables).  
   - Justin’s data lumps certain liabilities (e.g., “Accounts payable,” “Accrued expenses”) but does not confirm the system or how to retrieve individual creditor details.

5. **Material Entity Subsidiaries**  
   - The text requires coverage for each **CIDI subsidiary** that is a material entity.  
   - The responses focus on CIBC Bank USA, with limited mention of any other material subsidiary. If any exist, we do not see how their non‐deposit liabilities are tracked or recorded.

6. **Record Location & Timeliness**  
   - The requirement specifies describing the **location** of the bank’s records and recordkeeping practices.  
   - While references to monthly/quarterly reporting cycles exist, neither stakeholder response explains how **timely** or easily retrievable the data is in a potential resolution event.

---

## **Summary**

While the stakeholder responses outline:
- Some high‐level **balances** for non‐deposit liabilities (\$2 billion),
- The existence of **Credit Risk Management** processes for correspondents and derivatives,
- And references to multiple **reports** (Net Exposure, Collateral Snapshot, ACBS, etc.),

**they do not fully address**:

- A **central or integrated system** that captures **all** unsecured creditors (beyond capital markets/correspondents).  
- The **exact location** and format of records for each type of unsecured liability.  
- Whether any **inter‐creditor agreements** exist and how they are documented.  
- The ability to **produce** each unsecured creditor’s **name, address, liability nature,** and **amount** on demand.  
- Whether and how **material entity subsidiaries** maintain their own (potentially separate) unsecured liabilities tracking.

**Next Steps**: The CIDI’s final submission should explicitly **fill these gaps** by detailing:

1. **Full inventory** of non‐deposit liabilities—covering trade payables, obligations, or anything beyond deposit accounts.  
2. **Systems** used to track each category, with emphasis on how data can be **consolidated** or segmented by entity.  
3. **Record location** (physical/digital), frequency of updates, and **access** in a resolution scenario.  
4. Any **inter‐creditor agreements** or priority arrangements in place.  
5. Demonstration of the bank’s **capability** to list each creditor (or indenture trustee) with the required details.

Only by addressing these points can the bank meet the complete non‐deposit claims requirement.
