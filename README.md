INVESTIGATION OUTCOME
No SAR filed

Alerting transaction types
- Large cash deposit (ATM, personal account)
- Possible structured cash withdrawal (split, sub-$10 K withdrawals)

Events reviewed (3 Jan 2025 – 29 May 2025)
- 1 Mar 2025 – Deposits: customer made two back-to-back ATM cash deposits of $4,000 and $2,000. These amounts are larger than the account’s usual cash credits (typically $60 – $820) but remain below the $10 K currency-reporting threshold.
- 10 Mar 2025 – Withdrawal: single teller cash withdrawal of $1,000.
- 19 Mar 2025 – Withdrawals: two consecutive teller cash withdrawals of $9,500 and $1,000 at the same branch. Total cash out for the day was $10,500.

All other cash activity in the six-month window consisted of routine small deposits and minor debits.

General inflows and outflows
Pivot-table totals for the review period show overall debits of roughly **$64,500** distributed as follows:
•  Debit-card point-of-sale transactions – about **$19,900** (≈31 % of debits)  
•  ACH payments – about **$12,000** (≈19 %)  
•  Cash withdrawals – about **$11,200** (≈17 %)  
•  Peer-to-peer / real-time payments – about **$9,400** (≈15 %)  
•  Mobile or pin-less debit charges – about **$6,300** (≈10 %)  
•  Checks – about **$4,900** (≈8 %)  
Credits during the same period appear to mirror ordinary payroll ACH deposits and small incoming P2P transfers; total credit volume was approximately $[total-credit-amount] with average monthly inflows near $[average-monthly-credit].  Aside from the single $6,000 cash-deposit day, cash represented only about [cash-credit-percent]% of total incoming funds.

The pattern suggests a balanced household account that relies mainly on electronic channels, with cash activity playing a secondary role.  (Insert specific paycheck or P2P examples here as needed.)

Analysis — why the activity is not suspicious
1. Lack of pattern  
   Only one day shows split withdrawals; there are no additional sub-$10 K splits on other days, no multi-branch withdrawals, and no recurring attempts to stay below reportable limits.  Without repetition, the conduct does not demonstrate a structuring scheme.

2. Isolated large deposit  
   The $6,000 in ATM deposits occurred once and were followed by a two-week gap before any sizeable cash withdrawal.  An isolated increase, absent repetition or rapid cash-in/cash-out cycling, is insufficient to indicate illicit intent.

3. Regulatory reporting satisfied  
   Because the 19 Mar withdrawals aggregated to $10,500, a Currency-Transaction Report has been or will be filed.  This fulfills statutory cash-reporting requirements; the CTR alone does not make the activity suspicious.

4. Context and customer profile  
   Routine low-value deposits, normal debit-card spending, and no adverse media or high-risk occupation suggest ordinary personal banking.  No additional red flags — such as third-party involvement, funnel accounts, or links to known illicit networks — were identified.

Decision & monitoring plan
The single occurrence of split withdrawals and the one-time large deposit do not create a pattern consistent with structuring or other suspicious activity.  The case is closed without SAR filing.  The account will remain under standard monitoring, and any future sub-threshold splits or additional large cash deposits will trigger a new review.
