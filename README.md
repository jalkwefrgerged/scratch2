CIBC Bank USA reports total liabilities of approximately \$51.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which \$49.4 billion, or 96%, are deposits, leaving roughly \$2 billion in non‐deposit claims. A significant portion of these non‐deposit liabilities, around \$1.15 billion, arises from a note payable to CIBC Investments USA Inc. (an entity under CIBC Bancorp USA Inc.). Outside of that note payable, the Bank cites about \$850 million in other unsecured liabilities, primarily tied to Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) future capital contributions and derivative liabilities involving non‐correspondent entities. The Bank references “Finance monthly legal‐entity reports” for consolidated data on these amounts but does not expand on the specific triggers or recordkeeping methods used to track each component in real time.

To capture unsecured exposures, the Bank compiles a Correspondent Exposure Report, featuring a table that breaks down gross liability risk across various counterparties, including the entity known as “Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,” among others. In that table, line items for capital markets activities or other borrowings identify which counterparties carry negative mark‐to‐market exposures or short‐term funding lines. The Bank’s Credit Risk Management (CRM) team reviews aggregate exposure levels monthly and reports them to the Chief Credit Officer, with quarterly updates provided to the Correspondent Risk Committee as prescribed by the Bank’s Correspondent Credit Risk Management Policy. This policy outlines how unsecured funding exposures to each relevant institution are tracked. Within the exposure report, there are two primary schedules for identifying unsecured creditors: one labeled “Trade,” relating to letters of credit lines, and another labeled “Capital Markets,” covering derivative transactions. For any letters of credit that may be confirmed by an unsecured bank, the Bank clarifies that a separate deposit account is maintained to settle fees or drawdowns as they occur.

Under capital markets operations, the Bank tracks mark‐to‐market positions through a “Collateral Snapshot,” reflecting whether it has unsecured exposure due to negative valuations on derivative contracts. The Bank references the fact that once an institution is approved, it is recorded in the Net Exposure Report, typically under an International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement with a Credit Support Annex (CSA). While this provides some insight into how the Bank monitors collateral and margin posting, no additional detail is given on how each unsecured exposure would be itemized by name, address, and precise liability type, should a resolution scenario require a full listing of creditors.

With respect to CRA future capital contributions, the Bank indicates a commitment totaling \$218.4 million within its liabilities, but the nature and due dates of these contributions are not further described. Similarly, derivative liabilities on the balance sheet reach \$183.5 million, yet the Bank only mentions the mark‐to‐market approach for capturing negative valuations; details such as the underlying maturities, contract terms, or inter‐creditor agreements remain unstated. Other liabilities like accounts payable, accrued expenses, or settlement obligations appear in partial form on the Bank’s financial statement but are not separately enumerated as unsecured claims in a single repository. Additionally, while references to the monthly LE reports and net exposure frameworks exist, the Bank does not outline a central system ensuring that all unsecured liabilities, beyond correspondents or derivatives, are comprehensively captured and retrievable for resolution planning.

In summary, the Bank identifies non‐deposit liabilities amounting to approximately \$2 billion, chiefly composed of an intercompany note payable, CRA‐related obligations, and derivative exposures. Certain risk monitoring practices, such as the Net Exposure Report, are in place to gauge and limit unsecured exposures, especially with correspondent counterparties. However, further detail would be needed to confirm how each unsecured creditor is recorded by name, address, nature of the liability, or amount owed, and how the Bank maintains or accesses these records under potential resolution conditions.
