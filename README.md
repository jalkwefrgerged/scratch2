**Derivatives Exposures**  
CIBC Bank USA engages in various derivative instruments—such as interest rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps, options, and futures—to hedge balance sheet risks and facilitate client transactions. While the fair value of these derivatives may be recorded on the balance sheet, the notional amounts involved represent significant potential future obligations and are therefore treated as off-balance-sheet (OBS) exposures. To mitigate credit and market risks, the bank employs ISDA Master Agreements with Credit Support Annexes (CSAs), allowing for daily collateral postings and netting of exposures. Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are documented in accordance with relevant accounting standards (e.g., ASC 815) to reflect their intended risk-management purpose. All OBS derivatives are mapped to the bank’s core business lines (CBLs), franchise components (FCs), or material asset portfolios (MAPs) based on the underlying exposures or the line of business initiating the transaction. This approach ensures that each contract’s notional amount, liability structure, and potential impact on liquidity and capital are clearly identified, monitored in routine risk reports, and readily accessible for resolution planning.
