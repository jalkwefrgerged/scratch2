## [SECTION] Contingency Planning Exercises

### 1. Purpose and Background
- **Objective**: Explain that the purpose of this section is to describe any **contingency-planning** or **similar exercises** your institution conducted since the last filing.  
- **Link to Capabilities**: Highlight that these exercises are intended to **validate or enhance** resolution-related capabilities (e.g., deposit data, critical services continuity, MIS reporting, and communications).

---

### 2. Overview of Exercises Conducted
- **Name & Date**: List each exercise by a short title and indicate when it occurred.  
- **Scope**: State which departments or business lines participated, and which critical functions or operations were tested.  
- **Key Objectives**: Detail the high-level goals of each drillâ€”e.g., testing crisis management procedures, validating data accuracy, or coordinating with third-party vendors.

**Example**:  
> **Exercise**: Liquidity Stress Drill (April 2024)  
> **Scope**: Treasury, Finance, and Operations departments  
> **Objective**: Assess rapid funding-outflow scenarios and test real-time deposit tracking

### 3. Methodology and Scenario Details
- **Scenario(s)**: Describe the hypothetical event or conditions simulated (e.g., sudden deposit run, technology outage, or third-party vendor disruption).  
- **Approach**: Note whether it was a tabletop exercise, live simulation, or purely data-driven stress test.  
- **Key Assumptions**: Mention any major assumptions, such as interest-rate environments, deposit withdrawal rates, or operational constraints.

---

### 4. Results and Observations
- **Findings**: Summarize the major takeaways from each exercise:
  - **Strengths**: Where your institution performed well (e.g., timeliness in data retrieval, clear crisis-communication protocols).  
  - **Gaps/Weaknesses**: Areas needing improvement (e.g., slow system integration, incomplete depositor contact info, unclear third-party protocols).  
- **Metrics (If Available)**: Provide any noteworthy data (e.g., time to produce reports, amount of deposit outflow modeled, or speed of IT recovery).

**Example**:  
> - **Strength**: Demonstrated ability to generate a complete deposit trial balance within two hours.  
> - **Gap**: Lack of integrated contact database for commercial accounts slowed outreach in scenario.

### 5. Remediation Actions and Follow-Up
- **Action Items**: For each identified gap, note concrete solutions or enhancements being pursued:
  - New IT deployments or data integration  
  - Upgraded contract management or vendor oversight  
  - Staff training or role reassignments
- **Responsible Teams and Timelines**: Indicate who is leading each improvement project and target completion dates.

**Example**:  
> - **Remediation**: Implement a consolidated commercial account contact system by Q1 next year.  
> - **Owner**: Chief Information Officer (CIO) and IT Project Management Team.

---

### 6. Impact on Resolution Capabilities
- **Alignment With Submission**: Explain how addressing these findings will improve the resolution-related capabilities you describe elsewhere in your filing (e.g., deposit operations, management information systems, communication protocols).  
- **Benefits in a Stress or Failure Event**: Highlight how stronger data accuracy, coordination, or technology will enable a more orderly resolution, reduce operational disruptions, or expedite insurance determinations.

---

### 7. Future Plans
- **Upcoming Exercises**: If you have additional drills, simulations, or assessments planned, briefly note them (e.g., next liquidity stress test, new vendor continuity drill).  
- **Continuous Improvement**: Emphasize your commitment to regularly test and refine your contingency plans.

---

### 8. Governance and Review
- **Board/Committee Oversight**: State which internal governance body (e.g., Board Risk Committee, Enterprise Risk Management Committee) reviewed and approved the exercise plan or took note of the findings.  
- **Documentation**: Mention how the results, minutes, or after-action reports are documented and tracked for accountability.
