We engage in various intercompany transactions as part of the broader CIBC organization, including profit or loss sharing arrangements, infrastructure support services, and certain financial hedging relationships. Under our residual profit‐split methodology, profits or losses from specified global markets are allocated among ourselves and other CIBC entities based on factors such as capital at risk, resource support, and revenue‐generating functions like sales. Any related amounts are recorded as other non‐interest income in our consolidated statement of income. In addition to these residual allocations, we both provide and receive infrastructure support in areas such as technology, operations, and centrally managed processes, with resulting fees or costs recognized within employee compensation and benefits or other non‐interest expenses.

We have also entered into an immunization agreement intended to mitigate volatility associated with share‐based compensation. By offsetting the income statement impact of changes in our share price, this arrangement helps stabilize earnings when compensation awards are settled in cash. Furthermore, in order to improve our asset quality metrics, we maintain a credit default swap (“CDS”) with another CIBC entity, transferring a portion of credit exposure off our balance sheet. Both the immunization agreement and the CDS represent specific examples of inter‐affiliate collaborations that influence our financial and risk management strategies.

Beyond these arrangements, our disclosures reference other transactions, including loans, derivatives, and broader activities with CIBC entities, though no additional details on their structure, maturity, or termination provisions are provided here. We record certain allocations and reimbursements in line with CIBC’s agreed‐upon transfer pricing policies, ensuring that revenue and expense sharing reflects each entity’s role and resource usage. At present, we do not furnish further information about the particular contractual duration, collateral (if any), or fallback measures for these intercompany agreements. However, the aforementioned arrangements—profit‐split allocations, infrastructure support services, the immunization agreement for share‐based compensation, and the CDS for asset quality—collectively demonstrate our ongoing financial and operational ties with other affiliates in the CIBC group.
