Below is an updated analysis that **incorporates specific language** about market interest, feasibility of separation, viability, optionality, identification criteria, annual review processes, value drivers, synergy considerations, FMU dependencies, data room preparations, and other key points you highlighted. This ensures the response thoroughly addresses the requirement to identify franchise components that are **currently separable and marketable** in a timely manner in resolution.

## Key Elements of the Requirement

1. **Identification of Franchise Components**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - The CIDI must identify specific “franchise components” (FCs)—major business units, product sets, or operational segments—that can be **sold or spun off** during resolution.  
     - “Currently separable” means these FCs have enough **operational discreteness** to be decoupled **in a timely manner** without requiring major restructuring.  
     - The institution should provide the **results** of this process in a **table**, listing each FC.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - Regulators need clarity on **which parts of the bank** can be quickly carved out and **divested** to **maximize value** and **minimize disruption** in a resolution scenario.  
   - **Additional Detail – Identification Criteria:**  
     - **Annual Review & Approval Process:** Demonstrate a formal procedure (e.g., at least annual) where a committee reviews FC designations.  
     - **Methodology for Significance:** Define **quantitative thresholds** (e.g., a set % of total assets, liabilities, or revenue) alongside **qualitative factors** (e.g., operational interconnectedness to MEs/CBLs/FCs) used to decide if an FC is material enough to list.

2. **Marketability in a Timely Manner**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Show **market interest**: That each FC has sufficient buyer demand in a short resolution timeframe, supporting a **value-maximizing disposition**.  
     - Emphasize “**optionalities**” in how each FC can be sold (individually or combined) to accommodate different resolution strategies.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - Speed is critical for preserving **franchise value** and avoiding broader instability; regulators want to see **feasible** divestiture pathways.  
   - **Additional Detail – Market Interest & Optionality:**  
     - Outline **potential acquirers** (e.g., single-acquirer purchase-and-assumption vs. multiple buyers) and note that historical FDIC resolutions often rely on speed.  
     - Highlight unique attributes or “natural segmentation” that make each FC appealing, enhancing the bank’s **divestiture options** in a stress scenario.

3. **Value Drivers and Financial Viability**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Analyze each FC’s **revenue value drivers** (e.g., fee revenue, net interest income) and **cost value drivers** (e.g., fixed vs. variable costs) to illustrate underlying profitability.  
     - Show that separation of each FC will not threaten the **financial viability** of either the remaining entity or the FC itself.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - **Buyers** look for stable revenue sources and manageable cost structures.  
     - **Regulators** need assurance that pulling out an FC does not destabilize the bank’s critical operations.  
   - **Additional Detail – MAQ Approach:**  
     - Reference the bank’s management accounting system (e.g., “MAQ management Analytics Qube”) for analyzing financial statements, revenue streams, and cost structures to confirm robust valuation.

4. **Evidence of Separability**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Demonstrate “**feasibility of separation**” operationally and legally—e.g., specifying which **contracts**, **client agreements**, or **regulatory notifications** might be needed.  
     - Consider whether the FC relies on shared technology, staff, or processes.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - A timely spinoff demands minimal entanglements with the broader institution’s infrastructure.  
   - **Additional Detail – Legal & Operational Analyses:**  
     - **Legal Analysis:** Evaluate **regulatory approvals**, cross-default clauses, or client contract dependencies that could slow divestiture.  
     - **Operational Analysis:** Identify **FMU (Financial Market Utility)** and **agent bank** dependencies for payments, clearing, settlement, etc. If an FC needs certain memberships or infrastructure to execute transactions, outline how that reliance continues or transitions after separation.

5. **Timing Considerations**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Provide a sense of how quickly each FC could be sold or transferred (e.g., in days/weeks/months) under crisis conditions.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - **Speed** is essential to preserving value and limiting contagion risk.  
   - **Additional Detail – Data Room & Readiness:**  
     - Prepare a **virtual data room** framework, including an inventory of critical reports for FDIC or bidders.  
     - Document how **bidder due diligence** would be facilitated (e.g., capabilities #26, #27).

6. **Potential Obstacles and Mitigations**  
   - **What It Requires:**  
     - Acknowledge any **risks to separability**, e.g., operational entanglements, joint services, or contractual obligations that could impede a “timely manner” separation.  
     - Outline mitigating actions (e.g., pre-negotiated stand-alone service agreements, alternative vendor contracts) to **enhance separability** and maintain **operational continuity**.  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     - Regulators must see that the bank can realistically address these barriers under duress.  
   - **Additional Detail – FC Combinations & Synergies:**  
     - Assess whether combining multiple FCs (due to overlapping clients or complementary products) might raise the **value** in resolution.

## Conclusion

To meet the requirement for **identifying currently separable and marketable franchise components**:

1. **List Franchise Components** in a structured way, applying a defined **identification process** (annual review, committee oversight, quantitative thresholds).  
2. **Demonstrate Market Interest & Feasibility** by noting each FC’s **value drivers**, synergy potential, and how it can be sold (individually or combined) to maximize value in a short timeframe.  
3. **Prove Operational & Legal Separability** with explicit references to necessary **contracts, technology, regulatory notifications**, and highlight steps to ensure minimal disruption (including consideration of **FMU** dependencies).  
4. **Ensure Preparedness** by documenting **data room** setup and other readiness measures enabling prompt bidder due diligence.  
5. **Address Potential Obstacles** through remediation strategies—covering everything from cross-default clauses to reliance on shared services—so each FC can be **viably** spun off without harming the CIDI’s overall resolution outcome.

By explicitly incorporating these points—**market interest, feasibility of separation, viability, optionality,** and the thorough methodology for identifying and analyzing FCs—the final submission will satisfy the requirement and showcase a robust plan for **value-maximizing dispositions** of franchise components in resolution.
