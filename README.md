INVESTIGATION OUTCOME
No SAR filed

Alerting transaction types
- Large cash deposit (ATM, personal account)
- Possible structured cash withdrawal (split, sub-$10 K withdrawals)

Events reviewed (3 Jan 2025 – 29 May 2025)
- 1 Mar 2025 – Deposits: customer made two back-to-back ATM cash deposits of $4,000 and $2,000. These amounts are larger than the account’s usual cash credits (typically $60 – $820) but remain below the $10 K currency-reporting threshold.  
- 10 Mar 2025 – Withdrawal: single teller cash withdrawal of $1,000.  
- 19 Mar 2025 – Withdrawals: two consecutive teller cash withdrawals of $9,500 and $1,000 at the same branch. Total cash out for the day was $10,500.  

All other cash activity in the six-month window consisted of routine small deposits and minor debits.

Analysis — why the activity is not suspicious
1. Lack of pattern  
   Only one day shows split withdrawals; there are no additional sub-$10 K splits on other days, no multi-branch withdrawals, and no recurring attempts to keep transactions just under reportable limits. Without repetition, the conduct does not demonstrate a structuring scheme.  

2. Isolated large deposit  
   The $6,000 in ATM deposits are larger than the customer’s norm, yet they occurred only once and were followed by a two-week gap before any sizeable cash withdrawal. An isolated increase, absent repetition or rapid cash-in/cash-out cycling, is insufficient to indicate illicit intent.  

3. Regulatory reporting satisfied  
   Because the 19 Mar withdrawals aggregated to $10,500, a Currency-Transaction Report has been or will be filed. This satisfies statutory cash-reporting requirements; the CTR alone does not make the activity suspicious.  

4. Context and customer profile  
   Routine low-value deposits, normal debit-card spending, and no adverse media or high-risk occupation suggest ordinary personal banking. No additional red flags—such as third-party involvement, funnel accounts, or links to known illicit networks—were identified.

Decision & monitoring plan  
The single occurrence of split withdrawals and the one-time large deposit do not create a pattern consistent with structuring or other suspicious activity. The case is closed without SAR filing. The account will remain under standard monitoring, and any future sub-threshold splits or additional large cash deposits will trigger a new review.
