Of course! Here are organized notes summarizing the HR-related topics from the transcript:

### Ownership and HR Role Clarification:
- HR is responsible for identifying **people risk**, but **not responsible for mitigation strategies**.
  - Mitigation strategies for personnel risks (e.g., retention, incentives) are primarily the responsibility of business lines and finance.
- HR provides frameworks, identifies people risks, but does not decide resource allocations or detailed mitigation strategies (e.g., retention awards, financial incentives).
- HR creates key personnel lists in collaboration with business units, but decisions about resource allocation and hiring remain business and finance decisions.

### Mitigation Strategy and HR’s Involvement:
- Mitigation strategies, including retention awards, hiring, compensation decisions, are a joint responsibility between business lines and finance.
- HR supports this by providing frameworks and generating necessary reports (e.g., Workday lists).
- HR does not execute or own the final mitigation decisions—only facilitates identification of key personnel and provides input regarding people-related risks.

### Key Personnel Identification:
- Key personnel should be identified by:
  - Job titles/functions
  - Compensation grade levels (such as "Level 7 and above" or equivalent)
  - Employee's legal employing entity
  - Location
  - Core business line affiliation
- Identification should consider:
  - Employees critical for capital and liquidity management
  - Employees needed for executing critical decisions during resolution
  - Those with expertise or relationships vital to maintaining franchise value or aiding in divestitures
- HR provides a general framework, but specific mitigation details (like who gets retained and how) should be determined by business lines.

### FDIC Expectations:
- The FDIC expects detailed mapping of key roles, especially for franchise components important for separability.
- FDIC wants to know the rationale behind identifying key personnel and the capability to regularly refresh these lists.
- Employee retention contracts or agreements are not explicitly required by FDIC but should be clearly articulated in terms of methodology and logic.

### Resolution and Business Continuity (BCM):
- The resolution scenario differs from typical BCM events (long-term vs. short-term disruptions).
- HR’s role in BCM is limited; BCM team (Nandita specifically) will primarily manage continuity-of-services issues.
- HR should collaborate closely with the BCM team to ensure correct identification and management of key personnel for long-term disruptions.

### Data and Reporting Systems:
- Current HR systems (e.g., Workday) do not fully support detailed identification by job family/function due to misalignment between HR job families and actual roles, particularly in the U.S.
- The recommended approach is to provide general descriptions (broad-brush approach) rather than overly prescriptive details, maintaining flexibility in identifying key roles.

### Next Steps:
- Update existing tables to include FDIC-required columns: employee titles/functions, location, core business lines, and legal employing entities.
- Confirm sources and accuracy of any diagrams or process maps (e.g., BCM-related process map).
- Address redundancy or irrelevance by deleting outdated information copied from the parent resolution plan.
- Clarify roles of committees or governance structures mentioned, particularly regarding HR's role or involvement.
- Ensure ongoing updates can be automated or easily refreshed in the future (e.g., flagging in Workday rather than using employee names).

These notes cover the major HR-focused points discussed and the clarifications needed regarding HR's role in the broader resolution planning effort.




Here’s an expanded explanation on the off-balance sheet exposures as discussed:

---

### **Off-Balance Sheet Exposures – Detailed Overview**

**1. Consolidated Reporting at Bank USA Level:**
- **Aggregate Values:**  
  - Instead of breaking out detailed dollar amounts by each franchise component, the plan should provide consolidated off-balance sheet commitment numbers at the Bank USA level.
- **Marking Alignment:**  
  - Use an **“X”** in the table to indicate which core business line the exposure relates to. This serves to link exposures with the relevant parts of the business without getting into granular dollar details per franchise component.

**2. Types of Exposures to Include:**
- **Client-Facing Swaps:**  
  - Include swaps (such as interest rate or FX swaps) that are offered to commercial clients.  
- **Offsetting or Hedging Swaps:**  
  - Document any corresponding hedging arrangements (e.g., swaps with third parties like JPMorgan) that are designed to offset the risk exposure.  
  - Clearly present both sides of these swaps to illustrate the netting effect and how risk is mitigated.
  
**3. Netting Considerations:**
- **Offsetting Positions:**  
  - Detail both the exposure that arises from the client side and the hedging exposures undertaken with counterparties.  
  - This dual view helps in demonstrating the effective net exposure.
- **Regulatory Expectations:**  
  - Ensure that the netting mechanism is clearly outlined to meet FDIC requirements, as they often look for clarity on how the bank’s risk is being managed through these positions.

**4. Clarity and Documentation:**
- **Table Layout:**  
  - The table should include consolidated dollar amounts and an “X” to denote alignment with core business lines, rather than splitting values by each component.
- **Narrative Explanation:**  
  - Alongside the table, provide a narrative that explains:
    - The rationale behind reporting the exposures at a consolidated level.
    - The methodology for netting exposures (how the client and hedging swaps counterbalance each other).
    - The significance of these exposures in terms of the bank’s overall risk profile.
    
**5. Additional Considerations:**
- **Materiality:**  
  - Emphasize providing the most material information at your comfort level, especially if granular details might trigger additional questions.
- **Comparison with Peers:**  
  - If applicable, consider including a brief discussion on how your off-balance sheet exposures compare with peer institutions, particularly regarding the netting and risk management approach.

### **Immediate Action Points for Finance:**
- **Update the Off-Balance Sheet Table:**
  - Consolidate the exposure values at the Bank USA level.
  - Mark each exposure with an “X” to indicate the associated core business line.
- **Include Swap Details:**
  - Clearly detail both client-facing and offsetting swaps to demonstrate how netting is achieved.
- **Document the Rationale:**
  - Prepare a narrative section that explains the consolidated reporting approach and netting methodology.
- **Review with Stakeholders:**
  - Confirm with the finance team and regulatory reviewers (like KPMG) that the approach meets FDIC expectations and clearly communicates the bank’s risk profile.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the FDIC and other stakeholders have a clear, consolidated view of the off-balance sheet exposures, while also understanding the risk mitigation through netting.
