Below is an example **off‐balance‐sheet (OBS) exposures disclosure** that aims to **cover as much of the regulatory requirement as possible** based on the stakeholder’s information. Whenever we reach a **portion of the requirement** that the stakeholder’s data does not fully address, we insert a sentence explicitly flagging that gap.

### **Off‐Balance‐Sheet (OBS) Exposures Disclosure**

CIBC Bank USA (“the Bank”) maintains a range of off‐balance‐sheet exposures, consistent with Section 9 requirements, including unfunded commitments, letters of credit, credit card settlement guarantees, derivative liabilities, and other contingent liabilities. Below is a discussion of these exposures **(i) identifying and describing them, (ii) mapping them to the Bank’s business lines or material asset portfolios**, and **(iii) explaining how the Bank tracks them**, including recordkeeping and risk management practices.

**1. Overall Summary of Off‐Balance‐Sheet Items**

The Bank’s largest OBS category is **unfunded commitments**, totaling approximately \$20.9 billion as of October 31, 2024, with an additional \$668.9 million in letters of credit and \$40.2 million in credit card settlement guarantees. The Bank also has derivative exposures with a mark‐to‐market (MTM) liability of about \$183.5 million, plus Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) unfunded commitments of \$246.9 million. These represent the primary off‐balance‐sheet obligations that might become on‐balance‐sheet liabilities under certain conditions.

*(**GAP**: A consolidated table showing each category, total amounts, and their associated business lines should be inserted here. For instance, “Unfunded Commitments, \$XX, linked to Corporate Lending.”)*

**2. Detailed Description of Each OBS Category**

**2.1 Unfunded Commitments**  
The Bank’s unfunded commitments, valued at \$20.9 billion, mainly comprise lines of credit to commercial and personal borrowers. These facilities convert into on‐balance‐sheet liabilities if borrowers draw on them. The Bank references an internal credit approval process in “LP Vision” and the ACBS system to track approvals and outstanding availability.

*(**GAP**: The Bank should explicitly list which core business lines—e.g., Corporate Banking, Retail Banking—each set of commitments is tied to.)*

**2.2 Letters of Credit**  
Letters of credit, totaling \$668.9 million, include financial standby, performance standby, and commercial LCs. Financial standby LCs become liabilities if the customer fails to pay its obligations, whereas performance standby LCs are triggered upon nonperformance of contractual obligations. Commercial LCs typically relate to trade transactions.  
*(**GAP**: The Bank has not supplied a breakdown correlating each letter of credit category to a specific product line or material asset portfolio. A short table of LCs—type, amount, business line—should be provided.)*

**2.3 Credit Card Settlement Guarantees**  
The Bank’s credit card settlement guarantee exposes it to a potential \$40.2 million in obligations if commercial clients fail to pay the third‐party card provider. Historically, losses have been minimal, and management does not carry a separate contingent liability.  
*(**GAP**: The Bank should confirm whether these guarantees are associated with a particular core business line, such as Corporate or Treasury Services, and discuss potential triggers in a resolution scenario.)*

**2.4 CRA Unfunded Commitments**  
The Bank has \$246.9 million in CRA and related partnership commitments, of which \$198.8 million is considered a liability on the balance sheet. These obligations typically come due according to partnership agreements or capital call events.

*(**GAP**: More detail is needed on how CRA obligations might be activated—specific triggers or schedules—and which business line or portfolio these obligations relate to.)*

**2.5 Derivative Liabilities**  
The Bank’s derivative exposures, at \$183.5 million MTM, reflect interest rate swaps or other instruments executed under ISDA/CSA agreements. The Collateral Snapshot and Net Exposure Report track daily margin calls and negative MTMs.  
*(**GAP**: The Bank should clarify which lines of business rely on derivatives—e.g., Treasury, Capital Markets—and confirm if all relevant derivative exposures are included in the total.)*

---

**3. Recordkeeping & Systems Used**

The Bank references several internal reports and systems to track these off‐balance‐sheet items. **ACBS** is used to manage unfunded commitments and record letters of credit, while **Collateral Snapshot** captures derivative activity. **Finance monthly LE reports** give consolidated figures on nondeposit liabilities, and the **Net Exposure Report** monitors exposure to correspondent banks. Nonetheless:

- *(**GAP**: The Bank has not explicitly stated where each system’s records are maintained, how they are backed up, or how they could be accessed rapidly under resolution conditions.)*  
- *(**GAP**: A cross‐reference or reconciliation among ACBS, Collateral Snapshot, and Net Exposure data—along with the naming of core business lines—would provide a complete map of these off‐balance‐sheet exposures.)*

---

**4. Trigger Events & Risk Management**

Unfunded commitments fund upon client drawdown, letters of credit convert if the underlying performance or payment conditions trigger, and derivatives create liabilities when negative market valuations persist. The Bank manages these exposures through:

- **Credit approvals** for client drawdowns (Loan Presentations).  
- **Collateral or margining** for derivative positions (ISDA/CSA).  
- **Periodic internal reviews** for risk rating changes or compliance checks.  

*(**GAP**: There is little detail on stress testing or scenario analysis for each off‐balance‐sheet item under adverse market conditions. The Bank should confirm if these exposures are included in stress tests and how frequently those are performed.)*

---

**5. Mapping to Business Lines or Material Asset Portfolios**

Section 9 requires that each off‐balance‐sheet exposure be mapped to a relevant line of business. The Bank has disclosed major categories but not systematically tied them to its core lines, such as Retail Banking, Corporate Lending, Treasury Operations, etc.

- *(**GAP**: Insert a list or table mapping each specific exposure to its line of business or franchise component, e.g., “Unfunded Corporate Loan Commitments: \$X in Corporate Banking.”)*

---

**6. Ability to Identify Each Exposure**

While the Bank’s stakeholder response references identifying letters of credit through ACBS, tracking derivative MTM in Collateral Snapshots, and referencing net exposures in monthly reports, it does not demonstrate how data could be consolidated into a single list enumerating:

- **Counterparty/Creditor Name**  
- **Address (if individual or corporate)**  
- **Nature of Liability**  
- **Amount or Notional**  
- **Trigger for Conversion**  

*(**GAP**: The Bank should confirm that these systems can produce a full roster of each off‐balance‐sheet item with the required details in a resolution scenario. For instance, how quickly can such a list be generated if regulators request it overnight?)*

**7. Conclusion & Next Steps**

CIBC Bank USA has provided the high‐level categories and amounts of its off‐balance‐sheet exposures, including unfunded commitments, letters of credit, credit card settlement guarantees, CRA investments, and derivatives. This data satisfies part of the Section 9 requirement, giving regulators an overview of the Bank’s OBS risk footprint. However, several **gaps** remain:

1. **Detailed Mapping** to business lines or material asset portfolios is not present.  
2. **Recordkeeping Locations** and rapid retrieval capabilities (especially in resolution) require further explanation.  
3. **Granular Counterparty Data** for each exposure type, including name, address, and liability triggers, is not detailed in the stakeholder response.  
4. **Stress Testing** or scenario analyses for these off‐balance‐sheet exposures are not mentioned.

Filling these gaps would ensure that, in a resolution scenario, the Bank can quickly identify off‐balance‐sheet liabilities, align them to the correct business lines, and manage or terminate these exposures in an orderly manner. By addressing each missing piece in a structured manner (e.g., with tables, expanded narratives, and explicit reference to the relevant systems), the Bank will fully comply with the regulatory requirement for off‐balance‐sheet exposure disclosure.
