All off-balance sheet exposures are evaluated along the following qualitative and quantitative dimensions to determine materiality.

Quantitative Criteria:
Asset Percentage: Material if off-balance sheet exposures exceed 15% of total assets as reported on the most recent audited financial statements and determined in accordance with recognized accounting standards.
Liability Percentage: Material if off-balance sheet exposures account for more than 10% of total liabilities, potentially affecting funding and liquidity profiles as indicated by the latest consolidated financial data.
Revenue Impact: Material if the exposures result in revenue deviations exceeding 10% from forecasted earnings over a defined reporting period, as confirmed by scenario analyses and stress testing methodologies.
Qualitative Criteria:
Operational: Material if the exposure leads to significant disruptions in business continuity or undermines internal controls, affecting the organizationâ€™s operational effectiveness.
Reputation: Material if the exposure causes a noticeable and sustained deterioration in public perception and stakeholder confidence.
Regulatory: Material if the exposure consistently raises concerns with supervisory authorities, suggesting potential non-compliance with established regulatory standards and increasing the likelihood of enforcement action.
