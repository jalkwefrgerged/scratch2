------------------------------------------------------------
4) KYC & SOURCE-OF-FUNDS ANALYSIS  
• Unemployed; Shanghai address (Gaorong Xiaoqu 3-2307 Lane 661 Wanhangdu Rd); WA phone +1-425-615-5397  
• No sanctions/adverse media; [N_DISSOLVED_SHOPS] dissolved e-commerce shops in Haikou.  
• Income check (120-day look-back) – cash credits USD [CASH_TOTAL] + Zelle credits USD [P2P_CREDIT_TOTAL] vs ACH income USD [ACH_TOTAL] (nil).  
• Cash withdrawals USD [CASH_WD_TOTAL] (e.g., USD [WD_EX1] on [WD_DATE1]).  
➜ Inflows far exceed legitimate income; dissolved entities suggest shell use.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) INFLOWS VS OUTFLOWS (OVERVIEW)  
• Inflows: self-funding Zelle credits + March structured cash deposits.  
• Outflows: internal transfers to related BofA accounts (USD 75 472 YTD); ACH bill-pays and card spend minimal.  
➜ Pass-through behaviour with related parties reinforces Structuring, Unusual P2P, and Unknown Source typologies.

------------------------------------------------------------
